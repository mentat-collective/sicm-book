# Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics

This repository contains an unofficial org-mode version of the complete text of
"Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics" by Gerald Jay Sussman and
Jack Wisdom. It is a port of the [CC BY-NC-SA-licensed second
edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/sicm_edition_2/book.html)
hosted by [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/), obtained by converting
@tgvaughan's [HTML Port](https://github.com/tgvaughan/sicm) to
[org-mode](https://orgmode.org) format via [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and then
doing much more conversion by hand.

Everything currently lives in the `org` folder.
