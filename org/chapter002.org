The motion of rigid bodies presents many surprising phenomena.

Consider the motion of a top. A top is usually thought of as an
axisymmetric body, subject to gravity, with a point on the axis of
symmetry that is fixed in space. The top is spun and in general executes
some complicated motion. We observe that the top usually settles down
into an unusual motion in which the axis of the top slowly precesses
about the vertical, apparently moving perpendicular to the direction in
which gravity is attempting to accelerate it.

Consider the motion of a book thrown into the air.^{[[#endnote_1][1]]}
Books have three main axes. If we idealize a book as a brick with
rectangular faces, the three axes are the lines through the centers of
opposite faces. Try spinning the book about each axis. The motion of the
book spun about the longest and the shortest axis is a simple regular
rotation, perhaps with a little wobble depending on how carefully it is
thrown. The motion of the book spun about the intermediate axis is
qualitatively different: however carefully the book is spun about the
intermediate axis, it tumbles.

The rotation of the Moon is peculiar in that the Moon always presents
the same face to the Earth, indicating that the rotational period and
the orbit period are the same. Considering that the orbit of the Moon is
constantly changing because of interactions with the Sun and other
planets, and therefore its orbital period is constantly undergoing small
variations, we might expect that the face of the Moon that we see would
slowly change, but it does not. What is special about the face that is
presented to us?

<<p120>>

A rigid body may be thought of as a large number of constituent
particles with rigid constraints among them. Thus the dynamical
principles governing the motion of rigid bodies are the same as those
governing the motion of any other system of particles with rigid
constraints. What is new here is that the number of constituent
particles is very large and we need to develop new tools to handle them
effectively.

We have found that a Lagrangian for a system with rigid constraints can
be written as the difference of the kinetic and potential energies. The
kinetic and potential energies are naturally expressed in terms of the
positions and velocities of the constituent particles. To write the
Lagrangian in terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities we
must specify functions that relate the generalized coordinates to the
positions of the constituent particles. In the systems with rigid
constraints considered up to now these functions were explicitly given
for each of the constituent particles and individually included in the
derivation of the Lagrangian. For a rigid body, however, there are too
many consituent particles to handle each one of them in this way. We
need to find means of expressing the kinetic and potential energies of
rigid bodies in terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities,
without going through the particle-by-particle details.

The strategy is to first rewrite the kinetic and potential energies in
terms of quantities that characterize essential aspects of the
distribution of mass in the body and the state of motion of the body.
Only later do we introduce generalized coordinates. For the kinetic
energy, it turns out a small number of parameters completely specify the
state of motion and the relevant aspects of the distribution of mass in
the body. For the potential energy, we find that for some specific
problems the potential energy can be represented with a small number of
parameters, but in general we have to make approximations to obtain a
representation with a manageable number of parameters.

* *2.1 Rotational Kinetic Energy*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-7
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
We consider a rigid body to be made up of a large number of constituent
particles with mass /m/_{/α/}, position

${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}$

, and velocities <<p121>>

${\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha}$

, with rigid positional constraints among them. The kinetic energy is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha} \cdot {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha}.}} & \left( 2.1 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

It turns out that the kinetic energy of a rigid body can be separated
into two pieces: a kinetic energy of translation and a kinetic energy of
rotation. Let's see how this comes about.

The configuration of a rigid body is fully specified given the location
of any point in the body and the orientation of the body. This suggests
that it would be useful to decompose the position vectors for the
constituent particles as the sum of the vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{X}$

to some reference position in the body and the vector

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

from the reference position to the particular constituent element with
index /α/:

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha} = \overset{\rightarrow}{X} + {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}.} & \left( 2.2 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Along paths, the velocities are related by

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha} = \overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}.} & \left( 2.3 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

So in terms of

$\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}}$

and

${\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}$

the kinetic energy is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\left( {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}} \right) \cdot \left( {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}} \right)}} & \\
{\qquad = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}}}\left( {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} \cdot \overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + 2\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} \cdot {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} + {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} \cdot {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}} \right).} & \left( 2.4 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

If we select the reference position in the body to be its /center of
mass/,

$$\begin{matrix}
{\overset{\rightarrow}{X} = \frac{1}{M}{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha},}}} & \left( 2.5 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$M = {\sum_{\alpha}m_{\alpha}}$

is the total mass of the body, then

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha} = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\left( {{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha} - \overset{\rightarrow}{X}} \right) = 0.}}}} & \left( 2.6 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p122>>

So along paths the relative velocities satisfy

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} = 0.}} & \left( 2.7 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The kinetic energy is then

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} \cdot \overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + {\sum_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} \cdot {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}.}}}} & \left( 2.8 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energy of the motion of the
total mass at the center of mass

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}M\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} \cdot \overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}},} & \left( 2.9 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

and the kinetic energy of rotation about the center of mass

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} \cdot {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}.}} & \left( 2.10 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Written in terms of appropriate generalized coordinates, the kinetic
energy is a Lagrangian for a free rigid body. If we choose generalized
coordinates so that the center of mass position is entirely specified by
some of them and the orientation is entirely specified by others, then
the Lagrange equations for a free rigid body will decouple into two
groups of equations, one concerned with the motion of the center of mass
and one concerned with the orientation.

Such a separation might occur in other problems, such as a rigid body
moving in a uniform gravitational field, but in general, potential
energies cannot be separated as the kinetic energy separates. So the
motion of the center of mass and the rotational motion are usually
coupled through the potential. Even in these cases, it is usually an
advantage to choose generalized coordinates that separately specify the
position of the center of mass and the orientation.

* *2.2 Kinematics of Rotation*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-8
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
The motion of a rigid body about a center of rotation, a reference
position that is fixed with respect to the body, is characterized
<<p123>>at each moment by a rotation axis and a rate of rotation. Let's
elaborate.

We can get from any orientation of a body to any other orientation of
the body by a rotation of the body. That this is true is called Euler's
theorem on rotations about a point.^{[[#endnote_2][2]]} We know that
rotations have the property that they do not commute: the composition of
successive rotations in general depends on the order of operation.
Rotating a book about the

$\widehat{x}$

axis and then about the /ẑ/ axis puts the book in a different
orientation than rotating the book about the /ẑ/ axis and then about the

$\widehat{x}$

axis. Nevertheless, Euler's theorem states that however many rotations
have been composed to reach a given orientation, the orientation could
have been reached with a single rotation. Try it! We take a book, rotate
it this way, then that, and then some other way---then find the rotation
that does the job in one step. So a rotation can be specified by an axis
of rotation and the angular amount of the rotation.

We can specify the orientation of a body by specifying the rotation that
takes the body to its actual orientation from some reference
orientation. As the body moves, the rotation that does this changes.

Let /q/ be the coordinate path that we will use to describe the motion
of the body. Let

$\mathcal{M}(q(t))$

be the rotation that takes the body from the reference orientation to
the orientation specified by /q/(/t/) (see
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-1][figure 2.1]]). Let

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right)$

be the vector to some constituent particle with the body in the
orientation specified by /q/(/t/), and let

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi_{\alpha}^{\prime}}$

be the vector to the same constituent with the body in the reference
orientation. Then

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right) = \mathcal{M}\left( {q\left( t \right)} \right)\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi_{\alpha}^{\prime}}.} & \left( 2.11 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The constituent vectors

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi_{\alpha}^{\prime}}$

do not depend on the configuration, because they are the vectors to the
positions of the constituents with the body in a fixed reference
orientation.

To compute the kinetic energy we will accumulate the contributions from
all of the constituent mass elements. So we need <<p124>>the velocities
of the constituents. The positions of the constituent particles, at a
given time /t/, are

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right) = \mathcal{M}\left( {q\left( t \right)} \right)\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi_{\alpha}^{\prime}} = M\left( t \right)\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi_{\alpha}^{\prime}},} & \left( 2.12 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$M = \mathcal{M} \circ q$

. The velocity is the time derivative

$$\begin{matrix}
{D{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right) = DM\left( t \right)\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi_{\alpha}^{\prime}}.} & \left( 2.13 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Using equation ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.12][2.12]]), we can write

$$\begin{matrix}
{D{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right) = DM\left( t \right)\left( {M\left( t \right)} \right)^{- 1}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right).} & \left( 2.14 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

So we have a time-varying linear differential equation that describes
the motion of the constituents. Let's look at the multiplier
/DM/(/t/)(/M/(/t/))^{−1}. Since /M/(/t/) is a rotation its matrix
representation is an orthogonal matrix *M*(/t/), with the property

${(\mathbf{M}(t))}^{- 1} = {(\mathbf{M}(t))}^{\mathcal{T}}$

. Because

$\mathbf{M}(t){(\mathbf{M}(t))}^{\mathcal{T}} = \mathbf{I}$

, its derivative is:

$$\begin{matrix}
{0 = D\left( {\mathbf{M}\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}} \right) = D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}} + \mathbf{M}\, D\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}.} & \left( 2.15 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

So

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}} = - \left( {D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}} \right)^{\mathcal{T}}.} & \left( 2.16 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can conclude that

$D\mathbf{M}\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}$

is antisymmetric.

Let *u* have components (/x/, /y/, /z/). Every 3 × 3 antisymmetric
matrix is of the following form:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathcal{A}\left( \mathbf{u} \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & {- z} & y \\
z & 0 & {- x} \\
{- y} & x & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}.} & \left( 2.17 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Multiplication by this matrix can be interpreted as the operation of
cross product with the vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{u}$

. The vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{u}$

has a matrix representation *u*.

The inverse of the function

$\mathcal{A}$

can be applied to any skew-symmetric matrix: we can use

$\mathcal{A}^{- 1}$

to extract the components of *u*.

We can interpret multiplication by

$D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}$

as a cross product with a vector that we call

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

, the /angular velocity vector/ with components */ω/*. So we can write

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\omega} = \mathcal{A}^{- 1}\left( {D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}} \right).} & \left( 2.18 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p125>>

[[file:images/Art_P400.jpg]]

In terms of the angular velocity vector, the differential equations for
the motion of the constituents (see equation
[[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.14][2.14]]) are

$$\begin{matrix}
{D{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right) = \overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}\left( t \right) \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}\left( t \right).} & \left( 2.19 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

If the angular velocity vector for a body is

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

then the velocities of the constituent particles are perpendicular to
the vectors to the constituent particles and proportional to the rate of
rotation of the body and the distance of the constituent particle from
the instantaneous rotation axis:

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} = \overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}.} & \left( 2.20 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The components */ω/′* of the angular velocity vector on the body axes
are

$\mathbf{\omega}\prime = \mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{\omega}$

, so

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\omega}\prime = \mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathcal{A}^{- 1}\left( {D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}} \right).} & \left( 2.21 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The relationship of the angular velocity vector to the path is a
kinematic relationship; it is valid for any path. Thus we can abstract
it to obtain the components of the angular velocity at a moment given
the configuration and velocity at that moment.

<<p126>>

** *Implementation of angular velocity functions*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: implementation-of-angular-velocity-functions

The following procedure gives the components of the angular velocity as
a function of time along the path:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (((M-of-q->omega-of-t M-of-q) q) t)
(define M-on-path (compose M-of-q q)) (define (omega-cross t) (* ((D
M-on-path) t) (transpose (M-on-path t)))) (antisymmetric->column-matrix

The procedure omega-cross produces the matrix representation of

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times$

. The procedure antisymmetric->column-matrix, which corresponds to the
function

$\mathcal{A}^{- 1}$

, is used to extract the components of the angular velocity vector from
the skew-symmetric

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times$

matrix.

The components of the angular velocity vector on a basis fixed in the
body, as a function of time, along the path are

{% highlight scheme %} (define (((M-of-q->omega-body-of-t M-of-q) q) t)
(* (transpose (M-of-q (q t))) (((M-of-q->omega-of-t M-of-q) q) t))) {%
endhighlight %}

We can get the procedures of local state that give the angular velocity
components by abstracting these procedures along arbitrary paths that
have given coordinates and velocities. The abstraction of a procedure of
a path to a procedure of state is accomplished by Gamma-bar (see
[[file:chapter001.html#h1-6d][section 1.9]]):

{% highlight scheme %} (define (M->omega M-of-q) (Gamma-bar
(M-of-q->omega-of-t M-of-q))) (define (M->omega-body M-of-q) (Gamma-bar
(M-of-q->omega-body-of-t M-of-q))) {% endhighlight %}

These procedures give the angular velocities as a function of state. We
will see them in action after we get some M-of-q's to work with,
starting in [[file:chapter002.html#h1-11][section 2.7]].

* *2.3 Moments of Inertia*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-8a
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
The rotational kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energy of each
of the constituents of the rigid body. We can rewrite the
<<p127>>rotational kinetic energy in terms of the angular velocity
vector and certain aggregate quantities determined by the distribution
of mass in the rigid body.

Substituting our representation of the relative velocity vectors into
the rotational kinetic energy, we obtain

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} \cdot {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} = {\sum_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\left( {\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right) \cdot \left( {\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right).}}}} & \left( 2.22 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We introduce an arbitrary spatially fixed rectangular coordinate system
with origin at the center of rotation and with basis vectors /ê/_{0},
/ê/_{1}, and /ê/_{2}, with the property that /ê/_{0} × /ê/_{1} =
/ê/_{2}. The components of

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

on this coordinate system are /ω/^{0}, /ω/^{1}, and /ω/^{2}. Rewriting

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

in terms of its components, the rotational kinetic energy becomes

$$\begin{matrix}
\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\left( {\left( {\sum_{i}{{\widehat{e}}_{i}\omega^{i}}} \right) \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right) \cdot \left( {\left( {\sum_{j}{{\widehat{e}}_{j}\omega^{j}}} \right) \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right)}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}{\sum_{ij}{\omega^{i}\omega^{j}}}{\sum_{\alpha}m_{\alpha}}\left( {{\widehat{e}}_{i} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right) \cdot \left( {{\widehat{e}}_{j} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}{\sum_{ij}{\omega^{i}\omega^{j}I_{ij},}}} & \left( 2.23 \right) \\
\end{array} \\
\end{matrix}$$

with

$$\begin{matrix}
{I_{ij} = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\left( {{\widehat{e}}_{i} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right) \cdot \left( {{\widehat{e}}_{j} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right).}}} & \left( 2.24 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The nine time-dependent quantities /I_{ij}/ are the components of the
/inertia tensor/ with respect to the chosen coordinate system.

Note what a remarkable form the kinetic energy has taken. All we have
done is interchange the order of summations, but now the kinetic energy
is written as a sum of products of components of the angular velocity
vector, which completely specify how the orientation of the body is
changing, and the quantity /I_{ij}/, which depends solely on the
distribution of mass in the body relative to the chosen coordinate
system.

We will deduce a number of properties of the inertia tensor. First, we
find a somewhat simpler expression for it. The components of the vector

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

are

$\left( {\xi_{\alpha}^{0},\xi_{\alpha}^{1},\xi_{\alpha}^{2}} \right)$

. If we rewrite

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

as a sum over its components and simplify the elementary vector products
of basis vectors, we can obtain the components of the inertia tensor.
<<p128>>We can arrange the components of the inertia tensor to form the
/inertia matrix/:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{I} = \begin{pmatrix}
I_{00} & I_{01} & I_{02} \\
I_{10} & I_{11} & I_{12} \\
I_{20} & I_{21} & I_{22} \\
\end{pmatrix}\,\,\,,} & \left( 2.25 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$$\begin{array}{lll}
I_{00} & {= {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{({{(\xi_{\alpha}^{1})}^{2} + {(\xi_{\alpha}^{2})}^{2}})}}}} & \\
I_{11} & {= {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{({{(\xi_{\alpha}^{0})}^{2} + {(\xi_{\alpha}^{2})}^{2}})}}}} & \\
I_{22} & {= {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{({{(\xi_{\alpha}^{0})}^{2} + {(\xi_{\alpha}^{1})}^{2}})}}}} & \\
I_{ij} & {= - {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}^{i}\xi_{\alpha}^{j}}}\,\,\,\,\text{for}\,\, i \neq j} & {(2.26)} \\
\end{array}$$

Note that the inertia tensor has real components and is symmetric:
/I_{jk}/ = /I_{kj}/.

We define the /moment of inertia/ about a line by

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\left( \xi_{\alpha}^{\bot} \right)^{2}}},} & \left( 2.27 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$\xi_{\alpha}^{\bot}$

is the perpendicular distance from the line to the constituent with
index /α/. The diagonal components of the inertia tensor /I_{ii}/ are
recognized as the moments of inertia about the lines coinciding with the
coordinate axes /ê_{i}/. The off-diagonal components of the inertia
tensor are called /products of inertia/.

The rotational kinetic energy of a body depends on the distribution of
mass of the body solely through the inertia tensor. Remarkably, the
inertia tensor involves only second-order moments of the mass
distribution with respect to the center of mass. We might have expected
the kinetic energy to depend in a complicated way on all the moments of
the mass distribution, interwoven in some complicated way with the
components of the angular velocity vector, but this is not the case.
This fact has a remarkable consequence: for the motion of a free rigid
body the detailed shape of the body does not matter. If a book and a
banana have the same inertia tensor, that is, the same second-order mass
moments, <<p129>>then if they are thrown in the same way the subsequent
motion will be the same, however complicated that motion is. The facts
that the book has corners and the banana has a stem do not affect the
motion except for their contributions to the inertia tensor. In general,
the potential energy of an extended body is not so simple and does
indeed depend on all moments of the mass distribution, but for the
kinetic energy the second moments are all that matter!

*Exercise 2.1: Rotational kinetic energy*

Show that the rotational kinetic energy can also be written

$$\begin{matrix}
{T_{R} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2},} & \left( 2.28 \right) \\

where /I/ is the moment of inertia about the line through the center of
mass with direction

$\widehat{\omega}$

, and /ω/ is the instantaneous rate of rotation.

*Exercise 2.2: Steiner's theorem*

Let /I/ be the moment of inertia of a body with respect to some given
line through the center of mass. Show that the moment of inertia /I/′
with respect to a second line parallel to the first is

$$\begin{matrix}
{I\prime = I + MR^{2}} & \left( 2.29 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /M/ is the total mass of the body and /R/ is the distance between
the lines.

*Exercise 2.3: Some useful moments of inertia*

Show that the moments of inertia of the following objects are as given:

*a.* The moment of inertia of a sphere of uniform density with mass /M/
and radius /R/ about any line through the center is

$\frac{2}{5}M\, R^{2}$

.

*b.* The moment of inertia of a spherical shell with mass /M/ and radius
/R/ about any line through the center is

$\frac{2}{3}M\, R^{2}$

.

*c.* The moment of inertia of a cylinder of uniform density with mass
/M/ and radius /R/ about the axis of the cylinder is

$\frac{1}{2}M\, R^{2}$

.

*d.* The moment of inertia of a thin rod of uniform density per unit
length with mass /M/ and length /L/ about an axis perpendicular to the
rod through the center of mass is

$\frac{1}{12}M\, L^{2}$

.

*Exercise 2.4: Jupiter*

*a.* The density of a planet increases toward the center. Provide an
argument that the moment of inertia of a planet is less than that of a
sphere of uniform density of the same mass and radius.

<<p130>>

*b.* The density as a function of radius inside Jupiter is well
approximated by

$$\rho\left( r \right) = \frac{M}{R^{3}}\frac{\sin\left( {{\pi r}/R} \right)}{{4r}/R},$$

where /M/ is the mass and /R/ is the radius of Jupiter. Find the moment
of inertia of Jupiter in terms of /M/ and /R/.

* *2.4 Inertia Tensor*

  :END:
The representation of the rotational kinetic energy in terms of the
inertia tensor was derived with the help of a rectangular coordinate
system with basis vectors /ê_{i}/. There was nothing special about this
particular rectangular basis. So, the kinetic energy must have the same
form in any rectangular coordinate system. We can use this fact to
derive how the inertia tensor changes if the body or the coordinate
system is rotated.

Let's talk a bit about /active/ and /passive/ rotations. The rotation of
the vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

by the rotation /R/ produces a new vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}\prime = R\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

. We may write

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

in terms of its components with respect to some arbitrary rectangular
coordinate system with orthonormal basis vectors /ê_{i}/:

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

= /x/^{0}/ê/_{0} + /x/^{1}/ê/_{1} + /x/^{2}/ê/_{2}. Let *x* indicate the
column matrix of components /x/^{0}, /x/^{1}, and /x/^{2} of

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

, and *R* be the matrix representation of /R/ with respect to the same
basis. In these terms the rotation can be written *x′* = *Rx*. The
rotation matrix *R* is a real orthogonal matrix.^{[[#endnote_3][3]]} A
rotation that carries vectors to new vectors is called an /active/
rotation.

Alternatively, we can rotate the coordinate system by rotating the basis
vectors, but leave other vectors that might be represented in terms of
them unchanged. If a vector is unchanged but the basis vectors are
rotated, then the components of the vector on the rotated basis vectors
are not the same as the components on the original basis vectors. Denote
the rotated basis vectors by

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime} = R{\widehat{e}}_{i}$

. The component of a vector along a basis vector is the dot product of
the vector with the basis vector. So the components of <<p131>>the
vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

along the rotated basis

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

are

$\left( x\prime \right)^{i} = \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \cdot {\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime} = \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \cdot \left( {R{\widehat{e}}_{i}} \right) = \left( {R^{- 1}\overset{\rightarrow}{x}} \right) \cdot {\widehat{e}}_{i}$

.^{[[#endnote_4][4]]} Thus the components with respect to the rotated
basis elements are the same as the components of the rotated vector

$R^{- 1}\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

with respect to the original basis. In terms of components, if the
vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

has components *x* with respect to the original basis vectors /ê_{i}/,
then the components *x′* of the same vector with respect to the rotated
basis vectors

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

are *x′* = *R*^{−1}*x*, or equivalently *x* = *Rx′*. A rotation that
actively rotates the basis vectors, leaving other vectors unchanged, is
called a /passive/ rotation. For a passive rotation the components of a
fixed vector change as if the vector were actively rotated by the
inverse rotation.

With respect to the rectangular basis /ê_{i}/ the rotational kinetic
energy is written

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}{\sum_{ij}{\omega^{i}\omega^{j}I_{ij}.}}} & \left( 2.30 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

In terms of matrix representations, the kinetic energy is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{\omega}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{I}\mathbf{\omega},} & \left( 2.31 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where */ω/* is the column of components representing

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

.^{[[#endnote_5][5]]} If we rotate the coordinate system by the passive
rotation /R/ about the center of rotation, the new basis vectors are

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime} = R{\widehat{e}}_{i}$

. The components */ω/′* of the vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

with respect to the rotated coordinate system satisfy

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\omega} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{\omega}\prime,} & \left( 2.32 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where *R* is the matrix representation of /R/. The kinetic energy is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}\left( \mathbf{\omega}\prime \right)^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{R}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{IR}\mathbf{\omega}\prime.} & \left( 2.33 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

However, if we had started with the basis

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

, we would have written the kinetic energy directly as

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{1}{2}\left( \mathbf{\omega}\prime \right)^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{I\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime,} & \left( 2.34 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p132>>

where the components are taken with respect to the

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

basis. Comparing the two expressions, we see that

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{I\prime} = \mathbf{R}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{IR}.} & \left( 2.35 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Thus the inertia matrix transforms by a similarity
transformation.^{[[#endnote_6][6]]}

* *2.5 Principal Moments of Inertia*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-9a
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
We can use the transformation properties of the inertia tensor
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.35][2.35]]) to show that there are
special rectangular coordinate systems for which the inertia tensor /I/′
is diagonal, that is,

$I_{ij}^{\prime} = 0$

for /i/ ≠ /j/. Let's assume that *I′* is diagonal and solve for the
rotation matrix *R* that does the job. Multiplying both sides of
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.35][2.35]]) on the left by *R*, we have

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{RI\prime} = \mathbf{IR}.} & \left( 2.36 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can examine pieces of this matrix equation by multiplying on the
right by a trivial column vector that picks out a particular column. So
we multiply on the right by the column matrix representation *e*/_{i}/
of each of the coordinate unit vectors /ê_{i}/. These column matrices
have a one in the /i/th row and zeros otherwise. Using

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{e}_{i}$

, we find

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{RI\prime}\mathbf{e}_{i} = \mathbf{IR}\mathbf{e}_{i} = \mathbf{I}\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}.} & \left( 2.37 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

On the other hand, the matrix *I′* is diagonal, so

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{RI\prime}\mathbf{e}_{i} = \mathbf{R}\mathbf{e}_{i}I_{ii}^{\prime} = I_{ii}^{\prime}\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}.} & \left( 2.38 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

So, from equations ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.37][2.37]]) and
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.38][2.38]]), we have

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{I}\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime} = I_{ii}^{\prime}\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime},} & \left( 2.39 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

which we recognize as an equation for the eigenvalue

$I_{ii}^{\prime}$

and

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}$

, the column matrix of components of the associated eigenvector.

<<p133>>

From

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}$

= *Re*/_{i}/, we see that the

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}$

are the columns of the rotation matrix *R*. Now, rotation matrices are
orthogonal, so

$\mathbf{R}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{R} = 1$

; thus the columns of the rotation matrix must be orthonormal---that is,

$\left( \mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime} \right)^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{e}_{j}^{\prime} = \delta_{ij}$

, where /δ_{ij}/ is one if /i/ = /j/ and zero otherwise. But the
eigenvectors that are solutions of equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.39][2.39]]) are not necessarily even
orthogonal. So we are not done yet.

If a matrix is real and symmetric then the eigenvalues are real.
Furthermore, if the eigenvalues are distinct then the eigenvectors are
orthogonal. However, if the eigenvalues are not distinct then the
directions of the eigenvectors for the degenerate eigenvalues are not
uniquely determined---we have the freedom to choose particular

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}$

that are orthogonal.^{[[#endnote_7][7]]} The linearity of equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.39][2.39]]) implies that the

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}$

can be normalized. Thus whether or not the eigenvalues are distinct we
can obtain an orthonormal set of

$\mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}$

. This is enough to reconstruct a rotation matrix *R* that does the job
we asked of it: to rotate the coordinate system to a configuration such
that the inertia tensor is diagonal. If the eigenvalues are not
distinct, the rotation matrix *R* is not uniquely defined---there is
more than one rotation matrix *R* that does the job.

The eigenvectors and eigenvalues are determined by the requirement that
the inertia tensor be diagonal with respect to the rotated coordinate
system. Thus the rotated coordinate system has a special orientation
with respect to the body. The basis vectors

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

therefore actually point along particular directions in the body. We
define the axes in the body through the center of mass with these
directions to be the /principal axes/. With respect to the coordinate
system defined by

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

, the inertia tensor is diagonal, by construction, with the eigenvalues

$I_{ii}^{\prime}$

on the diagonal. Thus the moments of inertia about the principal axes
are the eigenvalues

$I_{ii}^{\prime}$

. We call the moments of inertia about the principal axes the /principal
moments of inertia/.

For convenience, we often label the principal moments of inertia
according to their size: /A/ ≤ /B/ ≤ /C/, with principal axis unit
vectors /â/,

$\widehat{b}$

, /ĉ/, respectively. The positive direction along the principal axes can
be chosen so that /â/,

$\widehat{b}$

, /ĉ/ form a right-handed rectangular coordinate basis.

<<p134>>

Let *x* represent the matrix of components of a vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

with respect to the basis vectors /ê_{i}/. Recall that the components
*x′* of a vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x}$

with respect to the principal axis unit vectors

${\widehat{e}}_{i}^{\prime}$

satisfy

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{x\prime} = \mathbf{R}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{x}.} & \left( 2.40 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The components of a vector on the principal axis basis are sometimes
called the /body components/ of the vector.

If we choose the reference orientation of the body so that the principal
axes are aligned with the spatial axes

$\widehat{x}$

, /ŷ/, /ẑ/, then the rotation *R* that diagonalizes the inertia matrix
becomes the rotation *M* shown in [[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-1][figure
2.1]]. The axes /â/′,

$\widehat{b}\prime$

, /ĉ/′ then become the principal axes. The rotation matrix *M*
multiplies the column of components of a vector on the principal axes to
make a column of components of the vector in space.

Now let's rewrite the kinetic energy in terms of the principal moments
of inertia. If we choose our rectangular coordinate system so that it
coincides with the principal axes then the calculation is simple. Let
the components of the angular velocity vector on the principal axes be
(/ω^{a}/, /ω^{b}/, /ω^{c}/). Then, keeping in mind that the inertia
tensor is diagonal with respect to the principal axis basis, the kinetic
energy is just

$$\begin{matrix}
{T_{R} = \frac{1}{2}\left\lbrack {A{(\omega^{a})}^{2} + B{(\omega^{b})}^{2} + C{(\omega^{c})}^{2}} \right\rbrack.} & {(2.41)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Or as a program:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((T-body A B C) omega-body) (* 1/2 (+ (*
A (square (ref omega-body 0))) (* B (square (ref omega-body 1))) (* C
(square (ref omega-body 2)))))) {% endhighlight %}

*Exercise 2.5: A constraint on the moments of inertia*

Show that the sum of any two of the moments of inertia is greater than
or equal to the third moment of inertia. You may assume the moments of
inertia are with respect to orthogonal axes.

*Exercise 2.6: Principal moments of inertia*

For each of the configurations described below find the principal
moments of inertia with respect to the center of mass, and find the
corresponding principal axes.

*a.* A regular tetrahedron consisting of four equal point masses tied

<<p135>>

*b.* A cube of uniform density.

*c.* Five equal point masses rigidly connected by massless stuff. The
point masses are at the rectangular coordinates

(−1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1).

you will get to throw it later. Show that the principal axes are the

* *2.6 Vector Angular Momentum*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-10
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
The vector angular momentum of a particle is the cross product of its
position vector and its linear momentum vector. For a rigid body the
vector angular momentum is the sum of the vector angular momentum of
each of the constituents. Here we find an expression for the vector
angular momentum of a rigid body in terms of the inertia tensor and the
angular velocity vector.

The vector angular momentum of a rigid body is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha} \times \left( {m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha}} \right),}} & \left( 2.42 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}$

,

${\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha}$

, and /m_{α}/ are the positions, velocities, and masses of the
constituent particles. It turns out that the vector angular momentum
decomposes into the sum of the angular momentum of the center of mass
and the rotational angular momentum about the center of mass, just as
the kinetic energy separates into the kinetic energy of the center of
mass and the kinetic energy of rotation. As in the kinetic energy
demonstration ([[file:chapter002.html#h1-7][section 2.1]]), decompose
the position into the vector to the center of mass

$\overset{\rightarrow}{X}$

and the vectors from the center of mass to the constituent mass elements

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

:

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha} = \overset{\rightarrow}{X} + {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha},} & \left( 2.43 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

with velocities

$$\begin{matrix}
{{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}}_{\alpha} = \overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}.} & \left( 2.44 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p136>>

Substituting, the angular momentum is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\left( {\overset{\rightarrow}{X} + {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right) \times \left( {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}} + {\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}} \right).}} & \left( 2.45 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Multiplying out the product, and using the fact that

$\overset{\rightarrow}{X}$

is the center of mass and

$M = {\sum_{\alpha}m_{\alpha}}$

is the total mass of the body, the angular momentum is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\overset{\rightarrow}{X} \times \left( {M\,\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}}} \right) + {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha} \times \left( {m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}} \right).}}} & \left( 2.46 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The angular momentum of the center of mass is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\overset{\rightarrow}{X} \times \left( {M\,\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{X}}} \right),} & \left( 2.47 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

and the rotational angular momentum is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha} \times \left( {m_{\alpha}{\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha}} \right).}} & \left( 2.48 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Using

${\overset{˙}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}}_{\alpha} = \overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

, we get the rotational angular momentum vector

$$\begin{matrix}
{\overset{\rightarrow}{L} = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha} \times \left( {\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega} \times {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right).}}} & \left( 2.49 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can also reexpress the rotational angular momentum in terms of the
angular velocity vector and the inertia tensor, as we did for the
kinetic energy. In terms of components with respect to the basis
{/ê/_{0}, /ê/_{1}, /ê/_{2}}, this is

$$\begin{matrix}
{L_{j} = {\sum\limits_{k}{I_{jk}\omega^{k}}},} & \left( 2.50 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /I_{jk}/ are the components of the inertia tensor
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.24][2.24]]). The angular momentum and the
kinetic energy are expressed in terms of the same inertia tensor.

With respect to the principal-axis basis, the components of the angular
momentum have a particularly simple form:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
L_{a} & {= A\omega^{a}} & \\
L_{b} & {= B\omega^{b}} & \\
L_{c} & {= C\omega^{c}} & \left( 2.51 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

<<p137>>

Since the angular momenta are the partial derivatives of /T_{R}/ (see
equation [[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.41][2.41]]) with respect to the
angular velocities, they must be grouped as a down tuple (in matrix
language, a row matrix): /L/′ = [/L_{a}/, /L_{b}/, /L_{c}/]. As a
program:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((L-body A B C) omega-body) (down (* A
(ref omega-body 0)) (* B (ref omega-body 1)) (* C (ref omega-body 2))))
{% endhighlight %}

If *M* is the matrix representation of the rotation that takes an
angular-velocity vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}\prime$

to a rotated vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{\omega}$

, the components transform as */ω/* = *M/ω/′*.

When working with matrices it is more convenient to work with a column
matrix of the angular momentum components, so we introduce

$\mathbf{\overline{L}} = \mathbf{L}^{\mathcal{T}}$

. Using */ω/* = *M/ω/′* and equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.35][2.35]]) with *R* replaced by *M* we
derive an expression for the angular momentum

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\overline{L}} = \mathbf{I}\mathbf{\omega} = \mathbf{MI\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime = \mathbf{M\overline{L}\prime}.} & \left( 2.52 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Transposing this result, we see that the angular momentum components
must transform as

$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{L\prime}\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}$

:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (((L-space M) A B C) omega-body) (*
((L-body A B C) omega-body) (transpose M))) {% endhighlight %}

*Exercise 2.8: Rotational angular momentum*

Verify that expression ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.50][2.50]]) for
the components of the rotational angular momentum
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.49][2.49]]) in terms of the inertia
tensor is correct.

* *2.7 Euler Angles*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-11
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
To go further we must finally specify a set of generalized coordinates.
We first do this using the traditional /Euler angles/. Later, we find
other ways of describing the orientation of a rigid body.

We are using an intermediate representation of the orientation in terms
of the function

$\mathcal{M}$

of the generalized coordinates that gives the rotation that takes the
body from some reference orientation and rotates it to the orientation
specified by the generalized coordinates. Here we take the reference
orientation so that principal-axis unit vectors /â/,

$\widehat{b}$

, /ĉ/ are coincident with the basis vectors /ê_{i}/, labeled here by

$\widehat{x}$

, /ŷ/, /ẑ/.

<<p138>>

We define the Euler angles in terms of simple rotations about the
coordinate axes. Let /R_{x}/(/ψ/) be a right-handed rotation about the

$\widehat{x}$

axis by the angle /ψ/, and let /R_{z}/(/ψ/) be a right-handed rotation
about the /ẑ/ axis by the angle /ψ/. The function

$\mathcal{M}$

for Euler angles is written as a composition of three of these simple
coordinate axis rotations:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathcal{M}\left( {\theta,\varphi,\psi} \right) = R_{z}\left( \varphi \right) \circ R_{x}\left( \theta \right) \circ R_{z}\left( \psi \right),} & \left( 2.53 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

for the Euler angles /θ/, /φ/, /ψ/.

The Euler angles can specify any orientation of the body, but the
orientation does not always correspond to a unique set of Euler angles.
In particular, if /θ/ = 0 then the orientation is dependent only on the
sum /φ/ + /ψ/, so the orientation does not uniquely determine either /φ/
or /ψ/.

*Exercise 2.9: Euler angles*

It is not immediately obvious that all orientations can be represented
in terms of the Euler angles. To show that the Euler angles are adequate
to represent all orientations, solve for the Euler angles that give an
arbitrary rotation /R/. Keep in mind that some orientations do not
correspond to a unique representation in terms of Euler angles.

Though the Euler angles allow us to specify all orientations and thus
can be used as generalized coordinates, the definition of Euler angles
is pretty arbitrary. In fact no reasoning has led us to them. This is
reflected in our presentation of them by just saying “here they are.”
Euler angles are well suited for some problems, but cumbersome for
others.

There are other ways of defining similar sets of angles. For instance,
we could also take our generalized coordinates to satisfy

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathcal{M}\prime\left( {\theta,\varphi,\psi} \right) = R_{x}\left( \varphi \right) \circ R_{y}\left( \theta \right) \circ R_{z}\left( \psi \right).} & \left( 2.54 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Such alternatives to the Euler angles sometimes come in handy.

Each of the fundamental rotations can be represented as a matrix. The
rotation matrix representing a right-handed rotation about the /ẑ/ axis
by the angle /ψ/ is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{R}_{z}\left( \psi \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
{\cos\psi} & {- \sin\,\psi} & 0 \\
{\sin\,\psi} & {\cos\,\psi} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}} & \left( 2.55 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p139>>

and a right-handed rotation about the /x/ axis by the angle /ψ/ is
represented by the matrix

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{R}_{x}\left( \psi \right) = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & {\cos\psi} & {- \sin\psi} \\
0 & {\sin\psi} & {\cos\psi} \\
\end{pmatrix}.} & \left( 2.56 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The matrix that represents the rotation that carries the body from its
reference orientation to the actual orientation is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{M}\left( {\theta,\varphi,\psi} \right) = \mathbf{R}_{z}\left( \varphi \right)\mathbf{R}_{x}\left( \theta \right)\mathbf{R}_{z}\left( \psi \right).} & \left( 2.57 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The rotation matrices and their product can be constructed by simple
programs:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (Rz-matrix angle) (matrix-by-rows (list
(cos angle) (- (sin angle)) 0) (list (sin angle) (cos angle) 0) (list 0
0 1))) (define (Rx-matrix angle) (matrix-by-rows (list 1 0 0) (list 0
(cos angle) (- (sin angle))) (list 0 (sin angle) (cos angle)))) (define
(Euler->M angles) (let ((theta (ref angles 0)) (phi (ref angles 1)) (psi
(ref angles 2))) (* (Rz-matrix phi) (Rx-matrix theta) (Rz-matrix psi))))
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have a procedure that implements a sample

$\mathcal{M}$

, we can find the components of the angular velocity vector and the body
components of the angular velocity vector using the procedures
M-of-q->omega-of-t and M-of-q->omega-body-of-t from
[[file:chapter002.html#h1-8][section 2.2]]. For example,

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression (((M-of-q->omega-body-of-t
Euler->M) (up (literal-function 'theta) (literal-function 'phi)
(literal-function 'psi))) 't)) {% endhighlight %}

$$\begin{pmatrix}
{D\varphi\left( t \right)\sin\left( {\theta\left( t \right)} \right)\sin\left( {\psi\left( t \right)} \right) + \cos\left( {\psi\left( t \right)} \right)D\theta\left( t \right)} \\
{D\varphi\left( t \right)\sin\left( {\theta\left( t \right)} \right)\cos\left( {\psi\left( t \right)} \right) - \sin\left( {\psi\left( t \right)} \right)D\theta\left( t \right)} \\
{\cos\left( {\theta\left( t \right)} \right)D\varphi\left( t \right) + D\psi\left( t \right)} \\
\end{pmatrix}$$

To construct the kinetic energy we need the procedure of state that
gives the body components of the angular velocity vector:

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression ((M->omega-body Euler->M) (up 't
(up 'theta 'phi 'psi) (up 'thetadot 'phidot 'psidot)))) {% endhighlight
%}

$$\begin{pmatrix}
{\overset{˙}{\varphi}\sin\left( \psi \right)\sin\left( \theta \right) + \overset{˙}{\theta}\cos\left( \psi \right)} \\
{\overset{˙}{\varphi}\sin\left( \theta \right)\cos\left( \psi \right) - \overset{˙}{\theta}\sin\left( \psi \right)} \\
{\overset{˙}{\varphi}\cos\left( \theta \right) + \overset{˙}{\psi}} \\
\end{pmatrix}$$

We capture this result as a procedure:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (Euler-state->omega-body local) (let ((q
(coordinate local)) (qdot (velocity local))) (let ((theta (ref q 0))
(psi (ref q 2)) (thetadot (ref qdot 0)) (phidot (ref qdot 1)) (psidot
(ref qdot 2))) (let ((omega-a (+ (* thetadot (cos psi)) (* phidot (sin
theta) (sin psi)))) (omega-b (+ (* -1 thetadot (sin psi)) (* phidot (sin
theta) (cos psi)))) (omega-c (+ (* phidot (cos theta)) psidot))) (up
omega-a omega-b omega-c))))) {% endhighlight %}

<<p141>>

The kinetic energy can now be written:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((T-body-Euler A B C) local) ((T-body A B
C) (Euler-state->omega-body local))) {% endhighlight %}

We can define procedures to calculate the components of the angular
momentum on the principal axes:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((L-body-Euler A B C) local) ((L-body A B
C) (Euler-state->omega-body local))) {% endhighlight %}

We then transform the components of the angular momentum on the
principal axes to the components on the fixed basis /ê_{i}/:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((L-space-Euler A B C) local) (let
((angles (coordinate local))) (* ((L-body-Euler A B C) local) (transpose
(Euler->M angles))))) {% endhighlight %}

These procedures are local state functions, like Lagrangians.

* *2.8 Motion of a Free Rigid Body*
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
The kinetic energy, expressed in terms of a suitable set of generalized
coordinates, is a Lagrangian for a free rigid body. In
[[file:chapter002.html#h1-7][section 2.1]] we found that the kinetic
energy of a rigid body can be written as the sum of the rotational
kinetic energy and the translational kinetic energy. If we choose one
set of coordinates to specify the position and another set to specify
the orientation, the Lagrangian becomes a sum of a translational
Lagrangian and a rotational Lagrangian. The Lagrange equations for
translational motion are not coupled to the Lagrange equations for the
rotational motion. For a free rigid body the translational motion is
just that of a free particle: uniform motion. Here we concentrate on the
rotational motion of the free rigid body. We can adopt the Euler angles
as the coordinates that specify the orientation; the rotational kinetic
energy was expressed in terms of Euler angles in the previous section.

** *Conserved quantities*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: conserved-quantities
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
The Lagrangian for a free rigid body has no explicit time dependence, so
we can deduce that the energy, which is just the kinetic energy, is
conserved by the motion.

The Lagrangian does not depend on the Euler angle /φ/, so we can deduce
that the momentum conjugate to this coordinate is conserved. An explicit
expression for the momentum conjugate to /φ/ is

{% highlight scheme %} (define Euler-state (up 't (up 'theta 'phi 'psi)
(up 'thetadot 'phidot 'psidot))) (show-expression (ref (((partial 2)
(T-body-Euler 'A 'B 'C)) Euler-state) 1)) {% endhighlight %}

$\begin{array}{l}
{A\overset{˙}{\varphi}\left( {\sin\left( \theta \right)} \right)^{2}\left( {\sin\left( \psi \right)} \right)^{2} + A\overset{˙}{\theta}\cos\left( \psi \right)\sin\left( \theta \right)\sin\left( \psi \right)} \\
{\,\,\,\, + B\overset{˙}{\varphi}\left( {\cos\left( \psi \right)} \right)^{2}\left( {\sin\left( \theta \right)} \right)^{2} - B\overset{˙}{\theta}\cos\left( \psi \right)\sin\left( \theta \right)\sin\left( \psi \right)} \\
{\,\,\,\, + C\overset{˙}{\varphi}\left( {\cos\left( \theta \right)} \right)^{2} + C\overset{˙}{\psi}\cos\left( \theta \right)} \\
\end{array}$

We know that this complicated quantity is conserved by the motion of the
rigid body because of the symmetries of the Lagrangian.

If there are no external torques, then we expect that the vector angular
momentum will be conserved. We can verify this using the Lagrangian
formulation of the problem. First, we note that /L_{z}/ is the same as
/p_{φ}/. We can check this by direct calculation:

{% highlight scheme %} (- (ref ((L-space-Euler 'A 'B 'C) Euler-state) 2)
(ref (((partial 2) (T-body-Euler 'A 'B 'C)) Euler-state) 1)) {%
endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} 0 {% endhighlight %}

We know that /p_{φ}/ is conserved because the Lagrangian for the free
rigid body did not mention /φ/, so now we know that /L_{z}/ is
conserved. Since the orientation of the coordinate axes is arbitrary, we
know that if any rectangular component is conserved then all <<p143>>of
them are. So the vector angular momentum is conserved for the free rigid
body.

We could have seen this with the help of Noether's theorem (see
[[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-8-5][section 1.8.5]]). There is a continuous
family of rotations that can transform any orientation into any other
orientation. The orientation of the coordinate axes we used to define
the Euler angles is arbitrary, and the kinetic energy (the Lagrangian)
is the same for any choice of coordinate system. Thus the situation
meets the requirements of Noether's theorem, which tells us that there
is a conserved quantity. In particular, the family of rotations around
each coordinate axis gives us conservation of the angular momentum
component on that axis. We construct the vector angular momentum by
combining these contributions.

*** *2.8.1 Computing the Motion of Free Rigid Bodies*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_2-8-1
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
Lagrange's equations for the motion of a free rigid body in terms of
Euler angles are quite disgusting, so we will not show them here.
However, we will use the Lagrange equations to explore the motion of the
free rigid body.

Before doing this it is worth noting that the equations of motion in
Euler angles are singular for some configurations, because for these
configurations the Euler angles are not uniquely defined. If we set /θ/
= 0 then an orientation does not correspond to a unique value of /φ/ and
/ψ/; only their sum determines the orientation.

The singularity arises in the explicit Lagrange equations when we
attempt to solve for the second derivative of the generalized
coordinates in terms of the generalized coordinates and the generalized
velocities (see [[file:chapter001.html#h1-6b][section 1.7]]). The
isolation of the second derivative requires multiplying by the inverse
of ∂_{2}∂_{2}/L/. The determinant of this quantity becomes zero when the
Euler angle /θ/ is zero:

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression (determinant (((square (partial
2)) (T-body-Euler 'A 'B 'C)) Euler-state))) {% endhighlight %}

$$ABC\left( {\sin\left( \theta \right)} \right)^{2}$$

So when /θ/ is zero, we cannot solve for the second derivatives. When
/θ/ is small, the Euler angles can move very rapidly, and thus may be
difficult to compute reliably. Of course, the motion of the rigid body
is perfectly well behaved for any orientation. This is a problem of the
representation of that motion in Euler angles; it is a “coordinate
singularity.”

One solution to this problem is to use another set of Euler-like
coordinates for which Lagrange's equations have singularities for
different orientations, such as those defined in equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.54][2.54]]). So if as the calculation
proceeds the trajectory comes close to a singularity in one set of
coordinates, we can switch coordinate systems and use another set for a
while until the trajectory encounters another singularity. This solves
the problem, but it is cumbersome. For the moment we will ignore this
problem and compute some trajectories, being careful to limit our
attention to trajectories that avoid the singularities.

We will compute some trajectories by numerical integration and check our
integration process by seeing how well energy and angular momentum are
conserved. Then, we will investigate the evolution of the components of
angular momentum on the principal axis basis. We will discover that we
can learn quite a bit about the qualitative behavior of rigid bodies by
combining the information we get from the energy and angular momentum.

To develop a trajectory from initial conditions we integrate the
Lagrange equations, as we did in chapter 1. The system derivative is
obtained from the Lagrangian:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (rigid-sysder A B C)
(Lagrangian->state-derivative (T-body-Euler A B C))) {% endhighlight %}

The following program monitors the errors in the energy and in the
components of the angular momentum:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((monitor-errors win A B C L0 E0) state)
(let ((t (time state)) (L ((L-space-Euler A B C) state)) (E
((T-body-Euler A B C) state))) (plot-point win t (relative-error (ref L
0) (ref L0 0))) (plot-point win t (relative-error (ref L 1) (ref L0 1)))
(plot-point win t (relative-error (ref L 2) (ref L0 2))) (plot-point win
t (relative-error E E0)))) (define (relative-error value
reference-value) (if (zero? reference-value) (error "Zero reference
value -- RELATIVE-ERROR") (/ (- value reference-value)
reference-value))) {% endhighlight %}

We make a plot window to display the errors:

{% highlight scheme %} (define win (frame 0.0 100.0 -1.0e-12 1.0e-12))
{% endhighlight %}

The default integration method used by the system is Bulirsch--Stoer
(bulirsch-stoer), but here we set the integration method to be
quality-controlled Runge--Kutta (qcrk4), because the error plot is more
interesting:

{% highlight scheme %} (set-ode-integration-method! 'qcrk4) {%
endhighlight %}

We use evolve to investigate the evolution:

| (let ((A 1.0) (B (sqrt 2.0)) (C 2.0) | ; moments of inertia |
| (state0 (up 0.0                      | ; initial state      |

(up 1.0 0.0 0.0)

(up 0.1 0.1 0.1))))

(let ((L0 ((L-space-Euler A B C) state0))

(E0 ((T-body-Euler A B C) state0)))

((evolve rigid-sysder A B C)

state0

(monitor-errors win A B C L0 E0)

| 0.1        | ; step between plotted points |
| 100.0      | ; final time                  |
| 1.0e-12))) | ; max local truncation error  |

The plot that is developed of the relative errors in the components of
the angular momenta and the energy (see
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-2][figure 2.2]]) shows that we have been
successful in controlling the error in the conserved quantities. This
should give us some confidence in the trajectory that is evolved.

<<p146>>

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_2-8-2
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
The evolution of the components of the angular momentum on the principal
axes has a remarkable property. For almost every initial condition the
body components of the angular momentum periodically trace a simple
closed curve.

We can see this by investigating a number of trajectories and plotting
the components of angular momentum of the body on the principal axes
(see [[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-3][figure 2.3]]). To make this figure
a number of trajectories of equal energy were computed. The
three-dimensional space of body components is projected onto a
two-dimensional plane for display. Points on the back of this projection
of the ellipsoid of constant energy are plotted with lower density than
points on the front of the ellipsoid. For most initial conditions we
find a one-dimensional simple closed curve. Some trajectories on the
front side appear to cross trajectories on the back side, but this is an
artifact of projection. There is also a family of trajectories that
appear to intersect in two points, one on the front side <<p147>>and one
on the back side. The curve that is the union of these trajectories is
called a /separatrix/; it separates different types of motion.

#+caption: *Figure 2.3* Trajectories of the components of the angular
momentum vector on the principal axes, projected onto a plane. Each
closed curve, except for the separatrix, is a different trajectory. All
the trajectories shown here have the same energy.
[[file:images/Art_P475.jpg]]

What is going on? The state space for a free rigid body is
six-dimensional: the three Euler angles and their time derivatives. We
know four constants of the motion---the three spatial components of the
angular momentum, /L_{x}/, /L_{y}/, and /L_{z}/, and the energy, /E/.
Thus, the motion is restricted to a two-dimensional region of the state
space.^{[[#endnote_8][8]]} Our experiment shows that the components of
the angular momentum trace one-dimensional closed curves in the
angular-momentum subspace, so there is something more going on here.

The total angular momentum is conserved if all of the components are, so
we also have the constant

$$\begin{matrix}
{L^{2} = L_{x}^{2} + L_{y}^{2} + L_{z}^{2}.} & \left( 2.58 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p148>>

The spatial components of the angular momentum do not change, but of
course the projections of the angular momentum onto the principal axes
do change because the axes move as the body moves. However, the
magnitude of the angular momentum vector is the same whether it is
computed from components on the fixed basis or components on the
principal axis basis. So, the combination

$$\begin{matrix}
{L^{2} = L_{a}^{2} + L_{b}^{2} + L_{c}^{2},} & \left( 2.59 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

is conserved.

Using the expressions ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.51][2.51]]) for the
components of the angular momentum in terms of the components of the
angular velocity vector on the principal axes, the kinetic energy
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.41][2.41]]) can be rewritten in terms of
the angular momentum components on the principal axes:

$$\begin{matrix}
{E = \frac{1}{2}\left( {\frac{L_{a}^{2}}{A} + \frac{L_{b}^{2}}{B} + \frac{L_{c}^{2}}{C}} \right).} & \left( 2.60 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The two conserved quantities ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.59][2.59]]
and [[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.60][2.60]]) provide constraints on how
the components of the angular momentum vector on the principal axes can
change. We recognize the conservation of angular momentum constraint
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.59][2.59]]) as the equation of a sphere,
and the conservation of kinetic energy constraint
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.60][2.60]]) as the equation for a
triaxial ellipsoid. For every trajectory both constraints are satisfied,
so the components of the angular momentum move on the intersection of
these two surfaces, the energy ellipsoid and the angular momentum
sphere. The intersection of an ellipsoid and a sphere with the same
center is typically two closed curves, so an orbit is confined to one of
these curves. This sheds light on the puzzle posed at the beginning of
this section.

Because of our ordering /A/ ≤ /B/ ≤ /C/, the longest axis of this
triaxial ellipsoid coincides with the /ĉ/ direction (all the angular
momentum is along the axis of largest principal moment of inertia) and
the shortest axis of the energy ellipsoid coincides with the /â/ axis
(all the angular momentum is along the smallest moment of inertia).
Without actually solving the Lagrange equations, we have found strong
constraints on the evolution of the components of the angular momentum
on the principal axes.

To determine how the system evolves along these intersection curves we
have to use the equations of motion. We observe that the evolution of
the components of the angular momentum on <<p149>>the principal axes
depends only on the components of the angular momentum on the principal
axes, even though the values of these components are not enough to
completely specify the dynamical state. Apparently the dynamics of these
components is self-contained, and we will see that it can be described
in terms of a set of differential equations whose only dynamical
variables are the components of the angular momentum on the principal
axes (see [[file:chapter002.html#h1-12a][section 2.9]]).

We note that there are two axes for which the intersection curves shrink
to a point if we hold the energy constant and vary the magnitude of the
angular momentum. If the angular momentum starts at these points, the
conserved quantities constrain the angular momentum to stay there. These
points are /equilibrium/ points for the body components of the angular
momentum. However, they are not equilibrium points for the system as a
whole. At these points the body is still rotating even though the body
components of the angular momentum are not changing. This kind of
equilibrium is called a /relative equilibrium/. We can also see that if
the angular momentum is initially slightly displaced from one of these
relative equilibria, then the angular momentum is constrained to stay
near it on one of the intersection curves. The angular momentum vector
is fixed in space, so the principal axis of the equilibrium point of the
body rotates stably about the angular momentum vector.

At the principal axis with intermediate moment of inertia, the

$\widehat{b}$

axis, the intersection curves appear to cross. As we observed, the
dynamics of the components of the angular momentum on the principal axes
forms a self-contained dynamical system. Trajectories of a dynamical
system cannot cross,^{[[#endnote_9][9]]} so the most that can happen is
that if the equations of motion carry the system along the intersection
curve then the system can approach the crossing point only
asymptotically. So without solving any equations we can deduce that the
point of crossing is another relative equilibrium. If the angular
momentum is initially aligned with the intermediate axis, then it stays
aligned. If the system is slightly displaced from the intermediate axis,
then the evolution along the intersection curve will take the system far
from the relative equilibrium. So rotation about the axis of
intermediate moment of inertia is unstable---initial displacements of
the angular momentum, <<p150>>however small initially, become large.
Again, the angular momentum vector is fixed in space, but now the
principal axis with the intermediate principal moment does not stay
close to the angular momentum, so the body executes a complicated
tumbling motion.

This gives some insight into the mystery of the thrown book mentioned at
the beginning of the chapter. If one throws a book so that it is
initially rotating about either the axis with the largest moment of
inertia or the axis with the smallest moment of inertia (the shortest
and longest physical axes, respectively), the book rotates regularly
about that axis. However, if the book is thrown so that it is initially
rotating about the axis of intermediate moment of inertia (the
intermediate physical axis), then it tumbles, however carefully it is
thrown. You can try it with this book (but put a rubber band or string
around it first).

Before moving on, we can make some further physical deductions. Suppose
a freely rotating body is subject to some sort of internal friction that
dissipates energy but conserves the angular momentum. For example, real
bodies flex as they spin. If the spin axis moves with respect to the
body then the flexing changes with time, and this changing distortion
converts kinetic energy of rotation into heat. Internal processes do not
change the total angular momentum of the system. If we hold the
magnitude of the angular momentum fixed but gradually decrease the
energy, then the curve of intersection on which the system moves
gradually deforms. For a given angular momentum there is a lower limit
on the energy: the energy cannot be so low that there are no
intersections. For this lowest energy the intersection of the angular
momentum sphere and the energy ellipsoid is a pair of points on the axis
of maximum moment of inertia. With energy dissipation, a freely rotating
physical body eventually ends up with the lowest energy consistent with
the given angular momentum, which is rotation about the principal axis
with the largest moment of inertia (typically the shortest physical
axis).

Thus, we expect that given enough time all freely rotating physical
bodies will end up rotating about the axis of largest moment of inertia.
You can demonstrate this to your satisfaction by twirling a small bottle
containing some viscous fluid, such as correction fluid. What you will
find is that, whatever spin you try to put <<p151>>on the bottle, it
will reorient itself so that the axis of the largest moment of inertia
is aligned with the spin axis. Remarkably, this is very nearly true of
almost every body in the solar system for which there is enough
information to decide. The deviations from principal axis rotation for
the Earth are tiny: the angle between the angular momentum vector and
the /ĉ/ axis for the Earth is less than one
arc-second.^{[[#endnote_10][10]]} In fact, the evidence is that all of
the planets, the Moon and all the other natural satellites, and almost
all of the asteroids rotate very nearly about the largest moment of
inertia. We have deduced that this is to be expected using an elementary
argument. There are exceptions. Comets typically do not rotate about the
largest moment. As they are heated by the sun, material spews out from
localized jets, and the back reaction from these jets changes the
rotation state. Among the natural satellites, the only known exception
is Saturn's satellite Hyperion, which is tumbling chaotically. Hyperion
is especially out of round and subject to strong gravitational torques
from Saturn.

* *2.9 Euler's Equations*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-12a
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
For a free rigid body we have seen that the components of the angular
momentum on the principal axes comprise a self-contained dynamical
system: the variation of the principal axis components depends only on
the principal axis components. Here we derive equations that govern the
evolution of these components.

The starting point for the derivation is the conservation of the vector
angular momentum. The components of the angular momentum on the
principal axes are^{[[#endnote_11][11]]}

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime} = \mathbf{I\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime,} & \left( 2.61 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where */ω/′* is composed of the components of the angular velocity
vector on the principal axes and *I′* is the matrix representation of
the inertia tensor with respect to the principal axis basis:

<<p152>>

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{I\prime} = \begin{pmatrix}
A & 0 & 0 \\
0 & B & 0 \\
0 & 0 & C \\
\end{pmatrix}.} & \left( 2.62 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The body components of the angular momentum *L′* are related to the
components *L* on the fixed rectangular basis /ê_{i}/ by

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\overline{L}} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime},} & \left( 2.63 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where *M* is the matrix representation of the rotation that carries the
body and all vectors attached to the body from the reference orientation
of the body to the actual orientation.

The vector angular momentum is conserved for free rigid-body motion, and
so are its components on a fixed rectangular basis. So, along solution
paths,

$$\begin{matrix}
{0 = D\mathbf{\overline{L}} = D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime} + \mathbf{M}\, D\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime}.} & \left( 2.64 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Solving, we find

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime} = - \mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime}.} & \left( 2.65 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

In terms of */ω/′* this is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{\mathbf{I\prime}D\mathbf{\omega}\prime} & {= - \mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{I\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime} & \\
 & {= - \mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathcal{A}\left( {\mathbf{M}\mathbf{\omega}\prime} \right)\,\mathbf{M\, I\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime,} & \left( 2.66 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

where we have used equation ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.21][2.21]])
to write /D/*M* in terms of

$\mathcal{A}$

. The function

$\mathcal{A}$

has the property^{[[#endnote_12][12]]}

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{R}^{\mathcal{T}}\,\mathcal{A}\left( \mathbf{Rv} \right)\mathbf{R} = \mathcal{A}\left( \mathbf{v} \right)} & \left( 2.67 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

for any vector with components *v* and any rotation with matrix
representation *R*. Using this property of

$\mathcal{A}$

, we find /Euler's equations/:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{I\prime}D\mathbf{\omega}\prime = - \mathcal{A}\left( \mathbf{\omega}\prime \right)\mathbf{I\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime.} & \left( 2.68 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Euler's equations give the time derivative of the body components of the
angular velocity vector entirely in terms of the angular
<<p153>>velocity components and the principal moments of inertia. Let
/ω^{a}/, /ω^{b}/, and /ω^{c}/ denote the components of the angular
velocity vector on the principal axes. Then Euler's equations can be
written as the component equations

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{A\, D\omega^{a} = \left( {B - C} \right)\omega^{b}w^{c}} & \\
{B\, D\omega^{b} = \left( {C - A} \right)\omega^{c}\omega^{a}} & \\
{C\, D\omega^{c} = \left( {A - B} \right)\omega^{a}\omega^{b}.} & \left( 2.69 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

Alternatively, we can rewrite Euler's equations in terms of the
components of the angular momentum on the principal axes

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D\, L_{a} = \left( {\frac{1}{C} - \frac{1}{B}} \right)L_{b}L_{c}} & \\
{D\, L_{b} = \left( {\frac{1}{A} - \frac{1}{C}} \right)L_{a}L_{c}} & \\
{D\, L_{a} = \left( {\frac{1}{B} - \frac{1}{A}} \right)L_{a}L_{b}.} & \left( 2.70 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

These equations confirm that the time derivatives of the components of
the angular momentum on the principal axes depend only on the components
of the angular momentum on the principal axes.

Euler's equations are very simple, but they do not completely determine
the evolution of a rigid body---they do not give the spatial orientation
of the body. However, equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.21][2.21]]) and property
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.67][2.67]]) can be used to relate the
derivative of the orientation matrix to the body components of the
angular velocity vector:

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{M}\mathcal{A}\left( \mathbf{\omega}\prime \right).} & \left( 2.71 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

A straightforward method of using these equations is to integrate them
componentwise as a set of nine first-order ordinary differential
equations, with initial conditions determining the initial configuration
matrix. Together with Euler's equations, which describe how the body
components of the angular velocity vector change with time, this system
of equations governing the motion of a rigid body is complete. However,
the reader will no doubt have noticed that this approach is rather
wasteful. The fact that the orientation matrix can be specified with
only three parameters has not been taken into account. We should be
integrating three <<p154>>equations for the orientation, given */ω/′*,
not nine. To accomplish this we once again need to parameterize the
configuration matrix.

For example, we can use Euler angles to parameterize the orientation:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathcal{M}\left( {\theta,\varphi,\psi} \right) = \mathbf{R}_{z}\left( \varphi \right)\mathbf{R}_{x}\left( \theta \right)\mathbf{R}_{z}\left( \psi \right).} & \left( 2.72 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We form *M* by composing

$\mathcal{M}$

with an Euler coordinate path. Equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.71][2.71]]) can then be used to solve for
/Dθ/, /Dφ/, and /Dψ/. We find

$$\begin{matrix}
{\left( \begin{array}{l}
{D\theta} \\
{D\varphi} \\
{D\psi} \\
\end{array} \right) = \frac{1}{\sin\theta}\begin{pmatrix}
{\cos\psi\sin\theta} & {- \sin\psi\sin\theta} & 0 \\
{\sin\psi} & {\cos\psi} & 0 \\
{- \sin\psi\cos\theta} & {- \cos\psi\cos\theta} & {\sin\theta} \\
\end{pmatrix}\,\,\,\begin{pmatrix}
\omega^{a} \\
\omega^{b} \\
\omega^{c} \\
\end{pmatrix}.} & \left( 2.73 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

This gives us the desired equation for the orientation. Note that it is
singular for /θ/ = 0, as are Lagrange's equations. So Euler's equations
using Euler angles for the configuration have the same problem as did
the Lagrange equations using Euler angles. Again, this is a
manifestation of the fact that for /θ/ = 0 the orientation depends only
on /φ/+/ψ/. The singularity in the equations of motion for /θ/ = 0 does
not correspond to anything funny in the motion of the rigid body. A
practical solution to the singularity problem is to choose another set
of Euler-like angles that have a singularity in a different place, and
switch from one to the other when the going gets tough.

Euler's equations were derived for a free rigid body. In general, we
must be able to deal with external forcing. How do we do this? First, we
derive expressions for the vector torque. Then we include the vector
torque in the Euler equations.

We derive the vector torque in a manner analogous to the derivation of
the vector angular momentum. That is, we derive one component and then
argue that since the coordinate system is arbitrary, all components have
the same form.

<<p155>>

Suppose we have a rigid body subject to some potential energy that
depends only on time and the configuration. A Lagrangian is /L/ = /T/ −
/V/. If we use the Euler angles as generalized coordinates, the last of
the three active Euler rotations that define the orientation is a
rotation about the /ẑ/ axis by the angle /φ/. The Lagrange equation for
/φ/ gives^{[[#endnote_13][13]]}

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dp_{\varphi}{(t)} = - \partial_{1,1}V{({t;\theta{(t)},\varphi{(t)},\psi{(t)}})}.} & {(2.74)} \\

If we define /T_{z}/, the component of the torque about the /z/ axis, to
be minus the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the
angle of rotation of the body about the /z/ axis,

$$\begin{matrix}
{T_{z}\left( t \right) = - \partial_{1,1}V\left( {t;\theta\left( t \right),\varphi\left( t \right),\psi\left( t \right)} \right),} & \left( 2.75 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

then we see that

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dp_{\varphi}\left( t \right) = T_{z}\left( t \right).} & \left( 2.76 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We have already identified the momentum conjugate to /φ/ as one
component, /L_{z}/, of the vector angular momentum

$\overset{\rightarrow}{L}$

(see [[file:chapter002.html#h1-12][section 2.8]]), so

$$\begin{matrix}
{DL_{z}\left( t \right) = T_{z}.} & \left( 2.77 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Since the orientation of the reference rectangular basis vectors is
arbitrary, we may choose them any way that we please. Thus if we want
any component of the vector torque, we may choose the /z/-axis so that
we can compute it in this way. We can conclude that the vector torque
gives the rate of change of the vector angular momentum

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\overset{\rightarrow}{L} = \overset{\rightarrow}{T}.} & \left( 2.78 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Having obtained a general prescription for the vector torque, we address
how the vector torque may be included in Euler's equations. Euler's
equations expressed the fact that the vector angular <<p156>>momentum is
conserved. Let's return to that calculation, but now include a torque
with components *T* arranged as a column matrix:

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\mathbf{\overline{L}} = \mathbf{\overline{T}} = D\mathbf{M}\,\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime} + \mathbf{M}\, D\mathbf{\overline{L}\prime}.} & \left( 2.79 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Carrying out the same steps as before, we find

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{T_{a} = D\, L_{a} - \left( {\frac{1}{C} - \frac{1}{B}} \right)L_{b}L_{c}} & \\
{T_{b} = D\, L_{b} - \left( {\frac{1}{A} - \frac{1}{C}} \right)L_{a}L_{c}} & \\
{T_{c} = D\, L_{a} - \left( {\frac{1}{B} - \frac{1}{A}} \right)L_{a}L_{b},} & \left( 2.80 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

where the components of the torque on the principal axes are

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{\overline{T}\prime} = \mathbf{M}^{- 1}\mathbf{\overline{T}}.} & \left( 2.81 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

In terms of */ω/′* this is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{I\prime}D\mathbf{\omega}\prime + \mathcal{A}\left( \mathbf{\omega}\prime \right)\mathbf{I\prime}\mathbf{\omega}\prime = \mathbf{\overline{T}\prime};} & \left( 2.82 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

in components,

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{A\, D\omega^{a} - \left( {B - C} \right)\omega^{b}\omega^{c} = T_{a}} & \\
{B\, D\omega^{b} - \left( {C - A} \right)\omega^{c}\omega^{a} = T_{b}} & \\
{C\, D\omega^{c} - \left( {A - B} \right)\omega^{a}\omega^{b} = T_{c}.} & \left( 2.83 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

Note that the torque entered only the equations for the body angular
momentum and for the body angular velocity vector. The equations that
relate the derivative of the orientation to the angular velocity vector
are not modified by the torque. In a sense, Euler's equations contain
the dynamics, and the equations governing the orientation are kinematic.
Of course, Lagrange's equations must be modified by the potential that
gives rise to the torques; in this sense Lagrange's equations contain
both dynamics and kinematics.

*Exercise 2.13: Bicycle wheel*

*a.* Imagine that you are holding a bicycle wheel by the axle (in both
hands) and the wheel is spinning so that the top edge is going away from
your face. If you torque the wheel by pushing down with your right hand
and pulling up with your left hand the wheel will precess. Which way
does it try to turn?

<<p157>>

*b.* A free bicycle wheel rolls on a horizontal surface. If it starts to
tilt, the torque from gravity will cause the wheel to turn. Which way
will it turn? The reasoning that applied to part *a* does not directly
apply to the rolling bicycle wheel, which is not a holonomic system.
However, it is interesting to think about whether the behavior of the
two systems is related.

* *2.10 Axisymmetric Tops*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-12b
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
We have all played with a top at one time or another. For the purposes
of analysis we will consider an idealized top that does not wander
around. Thus, an ideal top is a rotating rigid body, one point of which
is fixed in space. Furthermore, the center of mass of the top is not at
the fixed point, which is the center of rotation, and there is a uniform
gravitational acceleration.

For our top we can take the Lagrangian to be the difference of the
kinetic energy and the potential energy. We already know how to write
the kinetic energy---what is new here is that we must express the
potential energy in terms of the configuration. In the case of a body in
a uniform gravitational field this is easy. The potential energy is the
sum of “/mgh/” for all the constituent particles:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}gh_{\alpha},}} & \left( 2.84 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /g/ is the gravitational acceleration, /h_{α}/ =

${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}$

· /ẑ/, and the unit vector /ẑ/ indicates which way is up. Rewriting the
vector to the constituents in terms of the vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{X}$

to the center of mass, the potential energy is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}g\left( {\overset{\rightarrow}{X} + {\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}} \right) \cdot \widehat{z}}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = gM\,\overset{\rightarrow}{X} \cdot \widehat{z} + g\left( {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}{\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}}} \right) \cdot \widehat{z}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = gM\,\overset{\rightarrow}{X} \cdot \widehat{z},} & \left( 2.85 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

where the last sum is zero because the center of mass is the origin of

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

. So the potential energy of a body in a gravitational field with
uniform acceleration is very simple: it is just /M gh/, where /M/ is the
total mass and

$h = \overset{\rightarrow}{X} \cdot \widehat{z}$

is the height of the center of mass.

<<p158>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.4* An axisymmetric top is a symmetrical rigid body
in a uniform gravitational field with one point of the body fixed in
space. The Euler angles used to specify the configuration are indicated.
[[file:images/Art_P508.jpg]]

Here we consider an axisymmetric top (see
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-4][figure 2.4]]). Such a top has an axis of
symmetry of the mass distribution, so the center of mass is on the
symmetry axis and the fixed point is also on the axis of symmetry.

In order to write the Lagrangian we need to choose a set of generalized
coordinates. If we choose them well we can take advantage of the
symmetries of the problem. If the Lagrangian does not depend on a
particular coordinate, the conjugate momentum is conserved, and the
complexity of the system is reduced.

The axisymmetric top has two apparent symmetries. The fact that the mass
distribution is axisymmetric implies that neither the kinetic nor the
potential energy is sensitive to the orientation of the top about that
symmetry axis. Additionally, the kinetic and potential energy are
insensitive to a rotation of the physical system about the vertical
axis, because the gravitational field is uniform.

We can take advantage of these symmetries by choosing appropriate
coordinates, and we already have a coordinate system <<p159>>that does
the job---the Euler angles.^{[[#endnote_14][14]]} We choose the
reference orientation so that the symmetry axis is vertical. The first
Euler angle, /ψ/, expresses a rotation about the symmetry axis. The next
Euler angle, /θ/, is the tilt of the symmetry axis of the top from the
vertical. The third Euler angle, /φ/, expresses a rotation of the top
about the /ẑ/ axis. The symmetries of the problem imply that the first
and third Euler angles do not appear in the Lagrangian. As a consequence
the momenta conjugate to these angles are conserved quantities. Let's
work out the details.

First, we develop the Lagrangian explicitly. The general form of the
kinetic energy about a fixed point is given by equation
[[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.41][2.41]]. The top is constrained so that
it pivots about a fixed point that is not at the center of mass. So the
moments of inertia that enter the kinetic energy are the moments of
inertia of the top with respect to the pivot point, not with respect to
the center of mass. If we know the moments of inertia about the center
of mass we can write the moments of inertia about the pivot in terms of
them (see [[file:chapter002.html#Exe_2-2][exercise 2.2]] on Steiner's
theorem). So let's assume the principal moments of inertia of the top
about the pivot are /A/, /B/, and /C/, and /A/ = /B/ because of the
symmetry.^{[[#endnote_15][15]]} We can use the computer to help us
figure out the Lagrangian for this special case:

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression ((T-body-Euler 'A 'A 'C) (up 't
(up 'theta 'phi 'psi) (up 'thetadot 'phidot 'psidot)))) {% endhighlight
%}

$$\frac{1}{2}\left( {\sin\left( \theta \right)} \right)^{2}A{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2} + \cos\left( \theta \right)\left( {\frac{1}{2}\cos\left( \theta \right)C{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2} + C\overset{˙}{\varphi}\overset{˙}{\psi}} \right) + \frac{1}{2}A{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}C{\overset{˙}{\psi}}^{2}$$

We can rearrange this a bit to get

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{T\left( {t;\theta,\varphi,\psi;\overset{˙}{\theta},\overset{˙}{\varphi},\overset{˙}{\psi}} \right)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}A\left( {{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + {\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta} \right) + \frac{1}{2}C\left( {\overset{˙}{\psi} + \overset{˙}{\varphi}\cos\theta} \right)^{2}.} & \left( 2.86 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

<<p160>>

In terms of Euler angles, the potential energy is

$$\begin{matrix}
{V\left( {t;\theta,\varphi,\psi;\overset{˙}{\theta},\overset{˙}{\varphi},\overset{˙}{\psi}} \right) = M\, gR\cos\theta,} & \left( 2.87 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /R/ is the distance of the center of mass from the pivot. The
Lagrangian is /L/ = /T/ − /V/. We see that the Lagrangian is indeed
independent of /ψ/ and /φ/, as expected.

There is no particular reason to look at the Lagrange equations. We can
assign that job to the computer when needed. However, we have already
seen that it may be useful to examine the conserved quantities
associated with the symmetries.

The energy is conserved, because the Lagrangian has no explicit time
dependence. Also, the energy is the sum of the kinetic and potential
energy /E/ = /T/ + /V/, because the kinetic energy is a homogeneous
quadratic form in the generalized velocities. The energy is

$$\begin{matrix}
{E = \frac{1}{2}A\left( {{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + {\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta} \right) + \frac{1}{2}C\left( {\overset{˙}{\psi} + \overset{˙}{\varphi}\cos\theta} \right)^{2} + M\, gR\cos\theta.} & \left( 2.88 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Two of the generalized coordinates do not appear in the Lagrangian, so
there are two conserved momenta. The momentum conjugate to /φ/ is

$$\begin{matrix}
{p_{\varphi} = \left( {A\left( {\sin\theta} \right)^{2} + C\left( {\cos\theta} \right)^{2}} \right)\,\,\overset{˙}{\varphi} + C\overset{˙}{\psi}\cos\theta.} & \left( 2.89 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The momentum conjugate to /ψ/ is

$$\begin{matrix}
{p_{\psi} = C\left( {\overset{˙}{\psi} + \overset{˙}{\varphi}\cos\theta} \right).} & \left( 2.90 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The state of the system at a moment is specified by the tuple

$\left( {t;\theta,\varphi,\psi;\overset{˙}{\theta},\overset{˙}{\varphi},\overset{˙}{\psi}} \right)$

. Because the two coordinates /φ/ and /ψ/ do not appear in the
Lagrangian, they do not appear in the Lagrange equations or the
conserved momenta. So the evolution of the remaining four state
variables, /θ/,

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

,

$\overset{˙}{\varphi}$

, and

$\overset{˙}{\psi}$

, depends only on those remaining state variables. This subsystem for
the top has a four-dimensional state space. The variables that did not
appear in the Lagrangian can be determined by integrating the
derivatives of these variables, which are determined separately by
solving the independent subsystem.

<<p161>>

The evolution of the top is described by a four-dimensional subsystem
and two auxiliary quadratures.^{[[#endnote_16][16]]} This subdivision is
a consequence of choosing generalized coordinates that incorporate the
symmetries. However, the choice of generalized coordinates that
incorporate the symmetries also gives conserved momenta. We can make use
of these momenta to simplify the formulation of the problem further.
Each conserved quantity can be used to locally eliminate one dimension
of the subsystem. In this case the subsystem has four dimensions and
there are three conserved quantities, so the system can be completely
reduced to quadratures. For the top, this can be done analytically, but
we think it is a waste of time to do so. Rather, we are interested in
extracting interesting features of the motion. We concentrate on the
energy and use the two conserved momenta to eliminate

$\overset{˙}{\varphi}$

and

$\overset{˙}{\psi}$

. After a bit of algebra we find:

$$\begin{matrix}
{E = \frac{1}{2}A{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + \frac{\left( {p_{\varphi} - p_{\psi}\cos\theta} \right)^{2}}{2A\left( {\sin\theta} \right)^{2}} + \frac{p_{\psi}^{2}}{2C} + M\, gR\cos\theta.} & \left( 2.91 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Along a path /θ/, where /Dθ/(/t/) is substituted for

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

, this is an ordinary differential equation for /θ/. This differential
equation involves various constants, some of which are set by the
initial conditions of the other state variables. The solution of the
differential equation for /θ/ involves no more than ordinary integrals.
So the top is essentially solved. We could continue this argument to
obtain the qualitative behavior of /θ/: Using the energy
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.91][2.91]]), we can plot the trajectories
in the plane of

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

versus /θ/ and see that the motion of /θ/ is simply periodic. However,
we will defer this until chapter 3, when we have developed more tools
for analysis.

Let's get real. Let's make a top out of an aluminum disk with a steel
rod through the center to make the pivot. Measuring the top very
carefully, we find that the moment of inertia of the top about the
symmetry axis is about 1.32 × 10^{−4} kg m^{2}, and the moment of
inertia about the pivot point is about 6.96 × 10^{−4} kg m^{2}. The
combination /gM R/ is about 0.112kg m^{2} s^{−2}. We spin the top up
with an initial angular velocity of

$\overset{˙}{\psi}$

= 200 rad s^{−1} (about 1910 rpm).

<<p162>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.5* The tilt angle /π/ − /θ/ of the top versus time.
The tilt of the top varies periodically. This motion is called
/nutation/.
[[file:images/Art_P517.jpg]]

#+caption: *Figure 2.6* The precession angle /φ/ of the top versus time.
The top precesses nonuniformly---the rate of precession varies as the
tilt varies.
[[file:images/Art_P518.jpg]]

<<p163>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.7* The rate of rotation ¶ $\overset{˙}{\psi}$ ¶ of
the top versus time. The rate of rotation of the top changes
periodically, as the tilt of the top varies.
[[file:images/Art_P519.jpg]]

The top initially has

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

= /φ/ = /ψ/ = 0 and is initially tilted with /θ/ = 0.4 rad. We then kick
it so that

$\overset{˙}{\varphi}$

= −10 rad s^{−1}. [[#Fig_2-5][Figures 2.5]]--[[#Fig_2-8][2.8]] display
aspects of the evolution of the top for 2 seconds. The tilt of the top
(measured by /θ/) varies in a periodic manner. The orientation about the
vertical is measured by /φ/: we see that the top also precesses, and the
rate of precession varies with /θ/. We also see that as the top bobs up
and down the rate of rotation of the top oscillates---the top spins
faster when it is more vertical. The plot of tilt versus precession
angle shows that in this case the top executes a looping motion. If we
do not kick it but just let it drop, then the loop disappears, leaving
just a cusp. If we kick it in the other direction, then there is no cusp
nor any looping motion.

*Exercise 2.14: Kinetic energy of the top*

The rotational kinetic energy of the top can be written in terms of the
principal moments of inertia with respect to the pivot point and the
angular velocity vector of rotation with respect to the pivot point.
Show that this formulation of the kinetic energy yields the same value
that one would obtain by computing the sum of the rotational kinetic
energy about its center of mass and the kinetic energy of the motion of
the center of mass.

<<p164>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.8* An idea of the actual motion of the top is
obtained by plotting the tilt angle /π/ − /θ/ versus the precession
angle /φ/. This is a “latitude-longitude” map showing the path of the
center of mass of the top. We see that, though the top has a net
precession, it executes a looping motion as it precesses.

*Exercise 2.15: Nutation of the top*

*a.* Carry out the algebra to obtain the energy
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.91][2.91]]) in terms of /θ/ and

*b.* Numerically integrate the Lagrange equations for the top to obtain
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-5][figure 2.5]], /θ/ versus time.

*c.* Note that the energy is a differential equation for

in terms of /θ/, with conserved quantities /p/_{/φ/}, /p_{ψ}/, and /E/

*Exercise 2.16: Precession of the top*

Consider a top that is rotating so that /θ/ is constant.

as a function of the conserved angular momenta and the equilibrium value
of /θ/.

*b.* For /θ/ to be at an equilibrium the acceleration /D/^{2}/θ/ must be

at the equilibrium in terms of the equilibrium /θ/ and

$\overset{˙}{\psi}$

.

<<p165>>

*c.* Find an approximate expression for the precession rate in the limit
that

$\overset{˙}{\psi}$

is large.

*d.* The Newtonian rule is that the rate of change of the angular

angular momentum is nearly the same as the angular momentum of rotation
about the symmetry axis. By equating the rate of change of this vector
angular momentum to the gravitational torque on the center of mass
develop an approximate formula for the precession rate.

*e.* Numerically integrate the top to check your deductions.

The rotation of planets and natural satellites is affected by the
gravitational forces from other celestial bodies. As an extended
application of the Lagrangian method for forced rigid bodies, we
consider the rotation of celestial objects subject to gravitational
forces.

We first develop the form of the potential energy for the gravitational
interaction of an extended body with an external point mass. With this
potential energy and the usual rigid-body kinetic energy we can form
Lagrangians that model a number of systems. We will take an initial look
at the rotation of the Moon and Mercury; later, after we have developed
more tools, we will return to study these systems.

*** *2.11.1 Development of the Potential Energy*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_2-11-1
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
The first task is to develop convenient expressions for the
gravitational potential energy of the interaction of a rigid body with a
distant point mass. A rigid body can be thought of as made of a large
number of mass elements, subject to rigid coordinate constraints. We
have seen that the kinetic energy of a rigid body is conveniently
expressed in terms of the moments of inertia of the body and the angular
velocity vector, which in turn can be represented in terms of a suitable
set of generalized coordinates. The potential energy can be developed in
a similar manner. We first represent the potential energy in terms of
moments of the mass distribution and later introduce generalized
coordinates as particular parameters of the potential energy.

<<p166>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.9* The gravitational potential energy of a point
mass and a rigid body is the sum of the gravitational potential energy
of the point mass with each constituent mass element of the rigid body.
[[file:images/Art_P521.jpg]]

The gravitational potential energy of a point mass and a rigid body (see
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-9][figure 2.9]]) is the sum of the
potential energy of the point mass with each mass element of the body:

$$\begin{matrix}
{- {\sum\limits_{\alpha}\frac{GM\prime m_{\alpha}}{r_{\alpha}}},} & \left( 2.92 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /M/′ is the mass of the external point mass, /r_{α}/ is the
distance between the point mass and the constituent mass element with
index /α/, /m_{α}/ is the mass of this constituent element, and /G/ is
the gravitational constant. Let /R/ be the distance of the center of
mass of the rigid body from the point mass. The distance from the center
of mass to the constituent with index /α/ is /ξ_{α}/. The distance
/r_{α}/ is then given by the law of cosines as

$r_{\alpha}^{2} = R^{2} + \xi_{\alpha}^{2} - 2\xi_{\alpha}R\cos\theta_{\alpha}$

, where /θ_{α}/ is the angle between the lines from the center of mass
to the constituent and to the point mass.

Because this is a three-dimensional body the distance /ξ_{α}/ and angle
/θ_{α}/ do not completely specify the position of the constituent mass
element; to do that one must also specify the angle of rotation about
the line between the center of mass and the external point mass. But the
potential energy does not depend on this angle.

The potential energy is then

$$\begin{matrix}
{- GM\prime{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{m_{\alpha}}{\left( {R^{2} + \xi_{\alpha}^{2} - 2\xi_{\alpha}R\cos\,\theta_{\alpha}} \right)^{1/2}}.}}} & \left( 2.93 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p167>>

This is complete, but we need to find a representation that does not
mention each constituent.

Typically, the size of celestial bodies is small compared to the
distance between them. We can make use of this to find a more compact
representation of the potential energy. If we expand the potential
energy in the small ratio /ξ_{α}///R/ we find

$$\begin{matrix}
{- GM\prime{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\frac{1}{R}{\sum\limits_{l}{\frac{\xi_{\alpha}^{l}}{R^{l}}P_{l}\left( {\cos\theta_{\alpha}} \right),}}}}} & \left( 2.94 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /P_{l}/ is the /l/th Legendre polynomial.^{[[#endnote_17][17]]}
Interchanging the order of the summations yields:

$$\begin{matrix}
{- \frac{GM\prime}{R}{\sum\limits_{l}{{\sum\limits_{\alpha}m_{\alpha}}\frac{\xi_{\alpha}^{l}}{R^{l}}P_{l}\left( {\cos\theta_{\alpha}} \right).}}} & \left( 2.95 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Successive terms in this expansion of the potential energy typically
decrease very rapidly because celestial bodies are small compared to the
distance between them. We can compute an upper bound to the size of
these terms by replacing each factor in the sum over /α/ by an upper
bound. The Legendre polynomials all have magnitudes less than one for
arguments in the range −1 to 1. The distances /ξ_{α}/ are all less than
some maximum extent of the body /ξ/_{max}. The sum over /m_{α}/ times
these upper bounds is just the total mass /M/ times the upper bounds.
Thus

$$\begin{matrix}
{\left| {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\frac{\xi_{\alpha}^{l}}{R^{l}}P_{l}\left( {\cos\theta_{\alpha}} \right)}} \right| \leq M\frac{\xi_{\max}^{l}}{R^{l}}.} & \left( 2.96 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We see that the upper bound on successive terms decreases by a factor
/ξ/_{max}//R/. Successive terms may be smaller still. For large bodies
the gravitational force is strong enough to overcome the
<<p168>>internal material strength of the body, so the body, over time,
becomes nearly spherical. Successive terms in the expansion of the
potential are measures of the deviation of the mass distribution from a
spherical mass distribution. Thus for large bodies the higher-order
terms are small because the bodies are nearly spherical.

Consider the first few terms in /l/. For /l/ = 0 the sum over /α/ just
gives the total mass /M/ of the rigid body. For /l/ = 1 the sum over /α/
is zero, as a consequence of choosing the origin of the

${\overset{\rightarrow}{\xi}}_{\alpha}$

to be the center of mass. For /l/ = 2 we have to do a little more work.
The sum involves second moments of the mass distribution, and can be
written in terms of moments of inertia of the rigid body:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}^{2}P_{2}\left( {\cos\theta_{\alpha}} \right)}} & {= {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}^{2}\left( {\frac{3}{2}\left( {\cos\theta_{\alpha}} \right)^{2} - \frac{1}{2}} \right)}}} & \\
 & {= {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}\xi_{\alpha}^{2}\left( {1 - \frac{3}{2}\left( {\sin\theta_{\alpha}} \right)^{2}} \right)}}} & \\
 & {= \frac{1}{2}\left( {A + B + C - 3I} \right),} & \left( 2.97 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

where /A/, /B/, and /C/ are the principal moments of inertia, and /I/ is
the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the line between the
center of mass of the body and the external point mass. The moment /I/
depends on the orientation of the rigid body relative to the line
between the bodies. The contributions to the potential energy up to /l/
= 2 are then^{[[#endnote_18][18]]}

$$\begin{matrix}
{- \frac{GM\, M\prime}{R} - \frac{G\, M\prime}{2R^{3}}\left( {A + B + C - 3I} \right).} & \left( 2.98 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Let /c_{a}/ = cos /θ_{a}/, /c_{b}/ = cos /θ_{b}/, and /c_{c}/ = cos
/θ_{c}/ be the direction cosines of the angles /θ_{a}/, /θ_{b}/ and
/θ_{c}/ between the principal axes /â/,

$\widehat{b}$

, and /ĉ/ and the line between the center of mass and the point mass.
(See [[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-10][figure 2.10]].) A little algebra
shows that

$I = c_{a}^{2}A + c_{b}^{2}B + c_{c}^{2}C$

higher-order terms in the expansion.

*** *2.11.2 Rotation of the Moon and Hyperion*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_2-11-2
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
The approximation to the potential energy that we have derived can be
used for a number of different problems. It can be used to investigate
the effect of oblateness on the motion of an artificial satellite about
the Earth, or to incorporate the effect of planetary oblateness on the
evolution of the orbits of natural satellites, such as the Moon or the
Galilean satellites of Jupiter. However, as the principal application
here, we will use it to investigate the rotational dynamics of natural
satellites and planets.

The potential energy depends on the position of the point mass relative
to the rigid body and on the orientation of the rigid body. Thus the
changing orientation is coupled to the orbital evolution; each affects
the other. However, in many situations the effect of the orientation of
the body on the evolution of the orbit may be ignored. One way to see
this is to look at the relative magnitudes of the two terms in the
potential energy ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.99][2.99]]). We already
know that the second term is guaranteed to be smaller than the first by
a factor of (/ξ/_{max}//R/)^{2}, but often it is much smaller still
because the body involved is nearly spherical. For example, the radius
of the Moon is about a third the radius of the Earth and the distance to
the Moon is about 60 Earth-radii. So the second term is smaller than the
first by a factor of order 10^{−4} due to the size factors. In addition,
the Moon is roughly spherical and for any orientation the combination
/A/ + /B/ + /C/ − 3/I/ is of order 10^{−4}/C/. Now /C/ is itself of
order

$\frac{2}{5}M\, R^{2}$

, because the density of the Moon does not vary strongly with radius. So
for the Moon the second term is of order 10^{−8} relative to the first.
Even radical changes in the orientation of the Moon would have little
dynamical effect on its orbit.

We can learn some important qualitative aspects of the orientation
dynamics by studying a simplified model problem. First, we assume that
the body is rotating about its largest moment of inertia. This is a
natural assumption. Remember that for a free rigid body the loss of
energy while conserving angular momentum leads to rotation about the
largest moment of inertia. This is observed for most bodies in the solar
system. Next, we assume that the spin axis is perpendicular to the
orbital motion. This is a good approximation for the rotation of natural
satellites, and is a natural consequence of tidal friction---dissipative
solid-body tides raised on the satellite by the gravitational
interaction with the planet. Finally, for simplicity we take the rigid
body to be moving <<p171>>on a fixed elliptic orbit. This may
approximate the motion of some physical systems, provided the time scale
of the evolution of the orbit is large compared to any time scale
associated with the rotational dynamics we are investigating. So we have
a nice toy problem, one that has been used to investigate the rotational
dynamics of Mercury, the Moon, and other natural satellites. It makes
specific predictions concerning the rotation of Phobos, a satellite of
Mars, that can be compared with observations. It provides a basic
explanation of the fact that Mercury rotates precisely three times for
every two orbits it completes, and is the starting point for
understanding the chaotic tumbling of Saturn's satellite Hyperion.

#+caption: *Figure 2.11* The spin-orbit model problem in which the spin
axis is constrained to be perpendicular to the orbit plane has a single
degree of freedom, the orientation of the body in the orbit plane. Here
the orientation is specified by the generalized coordinate /θ/.
[[file:images/Art_P538.jpg]]

We are assuming that the orbit does not change or precess. The orbit is
an ellipse with the point mass at a focus of the ellipse. The angle /f/
(see [[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-11][figure 2.11]]) measures the
position of the rigid body in its orbit relative to the point in the
orbit at which the two bodies are closest.^{[[#endnote_19][19]]} We
assume the orbit is a fixed ellipse, so the <<p172>>angle /f/ and the
distance /R/ are periodic functions of time, with period equal to the
orbit period. With the spin axis constrained to be perpendicular to the
orbit plane, the orientation of the rigid body is specified by a single
degree of freedom: the orientation of the body about the spin axis. We
specify this orientation by the generalized coordinate /θ/ that measures
the angle to the /â/ principal axis from the same line from which we
measure /f/, the line through the point of closest approach.

Having specified the coordinate system, we can work out the details of
the kinetic and potential energies, and thus find the Lagrangian. The
kinetic energy is

$$\begin{matrix}
{T\left( {t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}} \right) = \frac{1}{2}C{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2},} & \left( 2.100 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /C/ is the moment of inertia about the spin axis and the angular
velocity of the body about the /ĉ/ axis is

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

. There is no component of angular velocity on the other principal axes.

To get an explicit expression for the potential energy, write the
direction cosines in terms of /θ/ and /f/: cos /θ_{a}/ = − cos(/θ/ −
/f/), cos /θ_{b}/ = sin(/θ/ − /f/), and cos /θ_{c}/ = 0 because the /ĉ/
axis is perpendicular to the orbit plane. The potential energy is then

$$\begin{array}{l}
{- \frac{GMM\prime}{R}} \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, - \frac{1}{2}\frac{GM\prime}{R^{3}}\left\lbrack {\left( {1 - 3\,\cos^{2}\left( {\theta - f} \right)} \right)A + \left( {1 - 3\,\sin^{2}\left( {\theta - f} \right)} \right)B + C} \right\rbrack.} \\
\end{array}$$

Since we are assuming that the orbit is given, we need keep only terms
that depend on /θ/. Expanding the squares of the cosine and the sine in
terms of the double angles and dropping all the terms that do not depend
on /θ/, we find the potential energy for the
orientation^{[[#endnote_20][20]]}

$$\begin{matrix}
{V\left( {t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}} \right) = - \frac{3}{4}\frac{GM\prime}{R^{3}\left( t \right)}\left( {B - A} \right)\cos\, 2\left( {\theta - f\left( t \right)} \right).} & \left( 2.101 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p173>>

A Lagrangian for the model spin-orbit coupling problem is then /L/ = /T/
− /V/ :

$$\begin{matrix}
{L\left( {t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}} \right) = \frac{1}{2}C{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + \frac{3}{4}\frac{GM\prime}{R^{3}\left( t \right)}\left( {B - A} \right)\cos\, 2\left( {\theta - f\left( t \right)} \right).} & \left( 2.102 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We introduce the dimensionless “out-of-roundness” parameter

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathit{\epsilon} = \sqrt{\frac{3\left( {B - A} \right)}{C},}} & \left( 2.103 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

and use the fact that the orbital frequency /n/ and the semimajor axis
/a/ satisfy Kepler's third law, /n/^{2}/a/^{3} = /G/(/M/ + /M/′), which
is approximately /n/^{2}/a/^{3} = /GM/′ for a small body in orbit around
a much more massive one (/M/ ≪ /M/′). In terms of /ϵ/ and /n/ the
spin-orbit Lagrangian is

$$\begin{matrix}
{L\left( {t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}} \right) = \frac{1}{2}C{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + \frac{n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}C}{4}\frac{a^{3}}{R^{3}\left( t \right)}\cos\, 2\left( {\theta - f\left( t \right)} \right).} & \left( 2.104 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

This is a problem with one degree of freedom with terms that vary
periodically with time.

The Lagrange equations are derived in the usual manner:

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\theta\left( t \right) = - \frac{n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}C}{2}\frac{a^{3}}{R^{3}\left( t \right)}\sin\, 2\left( {\theta\left( t \right) - f\left( t \right)} \right).} & \left( 2.105 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The equation of motion is very similar to that of the periodically
driven pendulum. The main difference here is that not only is the
strength of the acceleration changing periodically, but in the
spin-orbit problem the center of attraction is also varying
periodically.

We can give a physical interpretation of this equation of motion. It
states that the rate of change of the angular momentum is equal to the
applied torque. The torque on the body arises because the body is out of
round and the gravitational force varies as the inverse square of the
distance. Thus the force per unit mass on the near side of the body is a
little more than the acceleration of the body as a whole, and the force
per unit mass on the far side of the body is a little less than the
acceleration of the body as a whole. Thus, relative to the acceleration
of the body as a <<p174>>whole, the far side is forced outward while the
inner part of the body is forced inward. The net effect is a torque on
the body that tries to align the long axis of the body with the line to
the external point mass. If /θ/ is a bit larger than /f/ then there is a
negative torque, and if /θ/ is a bit smaller than /f/ then there is a
positive torque, both of which would align the long axis with the point
mass if given a fair chance. The torque arises because of the difference
of the inverse /R/^{2} force across the body, so the torque is
proportional to /R/^{−3}. There is a torque only if the body is out of
round, for otherwise there is no handle to pull on. This is reflected in
the factor /B/ − /A/ in the expression for the torque. The potential
depends on the mass distribution as described by the moments of inertia,
and thus the body has the same dynamics if it is rotated by 180°. The
factor of 2 in the argument of sine reflects this symmetry. This torque
is called the “gravity gradient torque.”

To compute the evolution requires a lot of detailed preparation similar
to what has been done for other problems. There are many interesting
phenomena to explore. We can take parameters appropriate for the Moon
and find that Mr. Moon does not steadily point the same face to the
Earth, but instead constantly shakes his head in dismay at what goes on
here. If we nudge the Moon a bit, say by hitting it with an asteroid, we
find that the long axis oscillates back and forth with respect to the
direction that points to the Earth. For the Moon, the orbital
eccentricity is currently about 0.05, and the out-of-roundness parameter
is about /ϵ/ = 0.026. [[#Fig_2-12][Figure 2.12]] shows the angle /θ/ −
/f/ as a function of time for two different values of the “lunar”
eccentricity. The plot spans 50 lunar orbits, or a little under four
years. This Moon has been kicked by a large asteroid and has initial
rotational angular velocity

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

equal to 1.01 times the orbit frequency. The initial orientation is /θ/
= 0. The smooth trace shows the evolution if the orbital eccentricity is
set to zero. We see an oscillation with a period of about 40 lunar
orbits or about three years. The more wiggly trace shows the evolution
of /θ/ − /f/ with an orbital eccentricity of 0.05, near the current
lunar eccentricity. The lunar eccentricity superimposes an apparent
shaking of the face of the Moon back and forth with the period of the
lunar orbit. Though the Moon does slightly change its rate of rotation
during the course of its orbit, most of this shaking is due to the
nonuniform motion of the Moon in its elliptical orbit. This oscillation,
called the “optical libration of the Moon,” allows us to see a bit more
than half of the Moon's surface. The longer-period oscillation induced
by the kick is called the “free libration of the Moon.” It is “free”
because we are free to excite it by choosing appropriate initial
conditions. The mismatch of the orientation of the Moon caused by the
optical libration actually produces a periodic torque on the Moon, which
slightly speeds it up and slows it down during every orbit. The
resulting oscillation is called the “forced libration of the Moon,” but
it is too small to see in this plot.

<<p175>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.12* The angle /θ/ − /f/ versus time for 50 orbit
periods. The ordinate scale is ±1 radian. The Moon has been kicked so
that the initial rotational angular velocity is 1.01 times the orbital
frequency. The trace with fewer wiggles was computed with zero lunar
orbital eccentricity; the other trace was computed with lunar orbital
eccentricity of 0.05. The period of the rapid oscillations is the lunar
orbit period. These oscillations are due mostly to the nonuniform motion
of /f/.
[[file:images/Art_P546.jpg]]

The oscillation period of the free libration is easily calculated. We
see that the eccentricity of the orbit does not substantially affect the
period, so we consider the special case of zero eccentricity. In this
case /R/ = /a/, a constant, and /f/(/t/) = /nt/, where /n/ is the
orbital frequency.^{[[#endnote_21][21]]} The equation of motion becomes

$$\begin{matrix}
{D^{2}\theta\left( t \right) = - \frac{n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}}{2}\sin\, 2\left( {\theta\left( t \right) - nt} \right).} & \left( 2.106 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p176>>

Let /φ/(/t/) = /θ/(/t/) − /nt/, and consequently /Dφ/(/t/) = /Dθ/(/t/) −
/n/, and /D/^{2}/φ/ = /D/^{2}/θ/. Substituting these, the equation
governing the evolution of /φ/ is

$$\begin{matrix}
{D^{2}\varphi = - \frac{n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}}{2}\sin\, 2\varphi.} & \left( 2.107 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

For small deviations from synchronous rotation (small /φ/) this is

$$\begin{matrix}
{D^{2}\varphi = - n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\varphi,} & \left( 2.108 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

so we see that the small-amplitude oscillation frequency of /φ/ is /nϵ/.
For the Moon, /ϵ/ is about 0.026, so the period is about 1/0.026 orbit
periods or about 40 lunar orbit periods, which is what we observed.

It is perhaps more fun to see what happens if the out-of-roundness
parameter is large. After our experience with the driven pendulum it is
no surprise that we find abundant chaos in the spin-orbit problem when
the system is strongly driven by having large /ϵ/ and significant
orbital eccentricity /e/. There is indeed one body in the solar system
that exhibits chaotic rotation---Hyperion, a small satellite of Saturn.
Though our toy model is not adequate for a complete account of Hyperion,
we can show that it exhibits chaotic behavior for parameters appropriate
for Hyperion. We take /ϵ/ = 0.89 and /e/ = 0.1. [[#Fig_2-13][Figure
2.13]] shows /θ/ − /f/ for 50 orbits, starting with /θ/ = 0 and

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

= 1.05. We see that sometimes one face of the body oscillates facing the
planet, sometimes the other face oscillates facing the planet, and
sometimes the body rotates relative to the planet in either direction.

If we relax our restriction that the spin axis be fixed perpendicular to
the orbit, then we find that the Moon maintains this orientation of the
spin axis even if nudged a bit, but for Hyperion the spin axis almost
immediately falls away from this configuration. The state in which
Hyperion on average points one face to Saturn is dynamically unstable to
chaotic tumbling. Observations of Hyperion are consistent with the
deduction that it is chaotically tumbling.

*Exercise 2.18: Precession of the equinox*

The Earth spins very nearly about the largest moment of inertia, and the
spin axis is tilted by about 23° to the orbit normal. There is a
gravity-gradient torque on the Earth from the Sun that causes the spin
axis of the Earth to precess. Investigate this precession in the
approximation <<p177>>that the orbit of the Earth is circular and the
Earth is axisymmetric. Determine the rate of precession in terms of the
moments of inertia of the Earth.

*** *2.11.3 Spin-Orbit Resonances*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_2-11-3
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
Consider the motion of the Moon in synchronous rotation. We have seen
that if we give the Moon a kick so that it is not exactly pointing one
face to the Earth, then the face will oscillate back and forth relative
to the direction to the Earth. If we give it a really big kick, then
instead of oscillating it will spin relative to the direction to the
Earth. How do we understand this?

Let's look again at the equations of motion for the rotation of the Moon
when the orbit is circular (equation
[[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.106][2.106]]):

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\theta(t) = - \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\,\sin\, 2(\theta(t) - n)t).} & \left( 2.109 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Changing variables to /φ/(/t/) = /θ/(/t/) − /nt/ this equation becomes

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\varphi\left( t \right) = - \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\,\sin\, 2\varphi\left( t \right).} & \left( 2.110 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p178>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.14* Trajectories of /φ/ and ¶
$\overset{˙}{\varphi}$ ¶ in the spin-orbit problem when the orbital
eccentricity is zero.
[[file:images/Art_P553.jpg]]

This equation can be solved; it has an “energy-like” conserved quantity

$$\begin{matrix}
{E\left( {\varphi,\overset{˙}{\varphi}} \right) = \frac{C}{2}{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2} - \frac{C}{4}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\,\cos\left( {2\varphi} \right).} & \left( 2.111 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The solutions are just contours of this conserved quantity (see
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-14][figure 2.14]]). There are two centers
of oscillation corresponding to the two different faces of the Moon that
could point towards Earth. There are also trajectories that rotate
relative to the Earth. And there are separating trajectories that
divided the oscillating trajectories from the circulating trajectories.
Where these separating trajectories appear to cross, the system is at an
unstable equilibrium. The separating trajectories are asymptotic to the
unstable equilibria (a system on that trajectory takes an infinite time
to get to the equilibrium point). These asymptotic trajectories are
analogous to the trajectories of the simple pendulum that are asymptotic
to the vertical.

<<p179>>

The extent of the oscillation region can be evaluated with the help of
the conserved quantity /E/. Let's evaluate it on the separating
trajectory:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{E\left( {\pi/2,0} \right)} & {= \frac{C}{4}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2},} & \\
{E\left( {0,\Delta\overset{˙}{\varphi}} \right)} & {= \frac{C}{2}\Delta{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2} - \frac{C}{4}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}.} & \left( 2.112 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

Equating these and solving, we find the maximum extent of the
oscillating region:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\Delta\overset{˙}{\varphi} = n\mathit{\epsilon}.} & \left( 2.113 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

So we see that the out-of-roundness parameter /ϵ/ not only gives the
frequency of small-amplitude oscillations, but also gives the extent of
the oscillation region.

Mercury rotates exactly three times for every two times it goes around
the Sun, as discovered by Pettengill and Dyce in 1965, using Arecibo
radar. We can understand this spin-orbit resonance using our simple
spin-orbit model problem.

Let's first use qualitative reasoning to understand how the resonance
comes about. The spin-orbit equation of motion, equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.105][2.105]]), equates the rate of change
of the angular momentum to the gravity gradient torque. The torque is
proportional to the inverse cube of the distance, so it is largest when
the distance is smallest, at pericenter. For the purpose of qualitative
reasoning, consider the torque only at pericenter. Suppose Mercury is
rotating exactly three times for every two orbits. Then if the long axis
of Mercury is pointed at the Sun at one pericenter, it will point the
other end of this long axis the next time it passes pericenter (it will
have rotated one and a half times). Now, suppose Mercury is rotating a
little faster. Then if the long axis is aligned at one pericenter
passage, on the next pericenter passage it will have rotated a little
too much and the long axis will no longer point to the Sun. In this case
/θ/ − /f/ will be positive and there will be a negative torque, slowing
down the rotation a bit. Over many orbits the rotation of Mercury is
reduced. A similar argument shows that if Mercury is rotating slower
than three times for every two orbits, then the torques at succesive
pericenter passages will tend to increase the rotation rate. An
oscillation ensues.

<<p180>>

We can also understand this spin-orbit resonance analytically. The
right-hand side of the equation of motion (equation
[[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.105][2.105]]) has factors that vary
periodically with the orbit period:

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\theta\left( t \right) = - \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( \frac{a}{R\left( t \right)} \right)^{3}\sin\, 2\left( {\theta\left( t \right) - f\left( t \right)} \right),} & \left( 2.114 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where both /f/(/t/) and /R/(/t/) are periodic with period 2/π///n/. We
can expand this as a Fourier series:

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\theta\left( t \right) = - \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}{\sum\limits_{m = - \infty}^{\infty}{A_{m}\left( e \right)\sin\left( {2\theta\left( t \right) - mnt} \right),}}} & \left( 2.115 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where the coefficients /A_{m}/(/e/) are functions of the orbital
eccentricity /e/. The coefficients are proportional to /e/^{|/m/−2|} and
so for small eccentricity we need to consider only a few of
them.^{[[#endnote_22][22]]} We have

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{A_{1}{(e)}} & {= - \frac{e}{2} + o{(e^{3})}} & \\
{A_{2}{(e)}} & {= 1 - \frac{5e^{2}}{2} + o{(e^{4})}} & \\
{A_{3}{(e)}} & {= \frac{7e}{2} + o{(e^{3})}.} & {(2.116)} \\
\end{array}$$

All other terms are of higher order in /e/. With just the terms of order
/e/ or less, the equation of motion becomes

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{C\, D^{2}\theta\left( t \right)} & {= - \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\lbrack\sin\left( {2\theta\left( t \right) - 2nt} \right)} & \\
 & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, + \frac{7e}{2}\sin\left( {2\theta\left( t \right) - 3nt} \right)} & \\
 & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, - \frac{e}{2}\sin\left( {2\theta\left( t \right) - nt} \right)} & \\
 & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, + \cdots\rbrack.} & \left( 2.117 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

Suppose we are close to the 3:2 Mercury resonance. Then

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

is close to (3/2)/n/. So the combination /θ/(/t/) − (3/2)/nt/ is slowly
varying compared to the other two arguments: /θ/(/t/)−/nt/ and /θ/(/t/)−
(1/2)/nt/. The rapidly varying torques due to these other terms
<<p181>>tend to average out, leaving a slowly varying torque that
controls the motion.^{[[#endnote_23][23]]} The averaged equation of
motion for motion near the 3:2 resonance is then

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\theta\left( t \right) = - \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( \frac{7e}{2} \right)\,\sin(2\theta(t) - 3nt).} & \left( 2.118 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can solve this by changing variables to

$$\begin{matrix}
{\varphi\left( t \right) = \theta\left( t \right) - \left( {3/2} \right)nt.} & \left( 2.119 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The equation of motion becomes

$$\begin{matrix}
{C\, D^{2}\varphi\left( t \right) = \frac{C}{2}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( \frac{7e}{2} \right)\sin\left( {2\varphi\left( t \right)} \right).} & \left( 2.120 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

This has the “energy-like” conserved quantity

$$\begin{matrix}
{E\left( {\varphi,\overset{˙}{\varphi}} \right) = \frac{C}{2}{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2} - \frac{C}{4}n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( \frac{7e}{2} \right)\cos\left( {2\varphi} \right),} & \left( 2.121 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

which is very similar to the conserved quantity we found for the
zero-eccentricity synchronous rotation case considered earlier; see
equation ([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.111][2.111]]). Indeed the
trajectories are contours of the conserved quantity and look just like
those in [[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-14][figure 2.14]]. Using analogous
reasoning we can determine the extent of the oscillation region and find

$$\begin{matrix}
{\Delta\overset{˙}{\varphi} = n\mathit{\epsilon}\sqrt{\frac{7e}{2}.}} & \left( 2.122 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

This gives the approximate range of rotation rate over which Mercury can
oscillate stably in the 3:2 resonance.

The Euler angles provide a convenient way to parameterize the
orientation of a rigid body. However, the equations of motion derived
for them have singularities. Though we can avoid the singularities by
using other Euler-like combinations with different
<<p182>>singularities, this kludge is not very satisfying. Let's
brainstorm a bit and see if we can come up with something better.

What does it take to specify an orientation? Perhaps we can take a hint
from Euler's theorem. Recall that Euler's theorem states that any
orientation can be reached with a single rotation. So one idea to
specify the orientation of a body is to parameterize this single
rotation that does the job. To specify this rotation we need to specify
the rotation axis and the amount of rotation. We contrast this with the
Euler angles, which specify three successive rotations. These three
rotations need not have any relation to the single composite rotation
that gives the orientation. Isn't it curious that the Euler angles make
no use of Euler's theorem?

We can think of several ways of specifying a rotation. One way would be
to specify the rotation axis by the latitude and the longitude at which
the rotation axis pierces a sphere. The amount of rotation needed to
take the body from the reference position could be specified by one more
angle. We can predict, though, that this choice of coordinates will have
similar problems to those of the Euler angles: if the amount of rotation
is zero, then the latitude and longitude of the rotation axis are
undefined. So the Lagrange equations for these angles are probably
singular. Another idea, without this defect, is to represent the
rotation by the rectangular components of an orientation vector

$\overset{\rightarrow}{o}$

; we take the direction of the orientation vector to be the same as the
axis of rotation that takes the body from the reference orientation to
the present orientation, and the length of the orientation vector to be
the angle by which the body must be rotated, in a right-hand sense,
about the orientation vector. With this choice of coordinates, if the
angle of rotation is zero then the length of the vector is zero and has
no unwanted direction. This choice looks promising, but there is another
problem: a rotation by 2/π/ is equivalent to no rotation at all, so it
will not have a well-defined rotation vector. This can be fixed by
making the length of the orientation vector be the sine of half of the
angle of rotation rather than the angle of rotation. With this choice a
rotation by zero angle will have the same orientation vector as a
rotation by 2/π/. But there is still another problem: rotations by /θ/
and 2/π/ − /θ/ are not distinguished. We can solve this by keeping track
of the cosine <<p183>>of half the angle of rotation. (Actually we need
to know only the sign of the cosine, but the cosine is convenient.)
Wrapping this all up into 4-tuples gives us Hamilton's /quaternions/.

Let /θ/ be the angle of rotation about the axis

$\widehat{n}$

. The components of a quaternion representing this rotation are:

$$\begin{matrix}
{{({\cos{({\theta/2})},\,\,\sin{({\theta/2})}{\widehat{n}}_{x},\,\,\sin{({\theta/2})}{\widehat{n}}_{y},\,\,\sin{({\theta/2})}{\widehat{n}}_{z}})},} & {(2.123)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$\left( {{\widehat{n}}_{x},{\widehat{n}}_{y},{\widehat{n}}_{z}} \right)$

are rectangular components of

$\widehat{n}$

. The sum of the squares of the components of this quaternion is 1: it
is a /unit quaternion/. So there is a unit quaternion associated with
every rotation.

We can invert this: given a quaternion we can compute the angle and the
axis. Let (/r/, /x/, /y/, /z/) be the components of a quaternion /q/. We
separate the first component (called the /real part/) and the tuple /v/
= (/x/, /y/, /z/) (called the /3-vector/) of the remaining components.
The Euclidean norm of the tuple ‖/v/‖ = | sin(/θ//2)|. The first
component /r/ = cos(/θ//2). So the angle /θ/ = 2 arctan(‖/v/‖, /r/) and
the axis is /v//‖/v/‖. This process is independent of the scale of the
quaternion.

By taking the absolute value of sin(/θ//2) we have lost information
about the quadrant, but this is not a real problem because the rotation
represented by a quaternion is not changed by reversing the sign of all
its components: changing the sign of /v/ reverses the axis but does not
change the angle; changing the sign of the first component changes the
angle /θ/ to 2/π/ − /θ/, so the actual rotation is unchanged.

Given the four elements of a quaternion, we need to find the
corresponding rotation matrix. We can get the angle and axis given a
quaternion. We can get a rotation matrix given the angle /θ/ and the
axis given by a unit vector

$\widehat{n}$

. We rotate by /θ/ around the /ẑ/ axis, and then transform this rotation
to the axis specified by colatitude /φ/ and longitude /λ/:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{R}{({\theta,\widehat{n}})} = \mathbf{R}_{z}{(\lambda)}\mathbf{R}_{y}{(\varphi)}\mathbf{R}_{z}{(\theta)}{({\mathbf{R}_{y}{(\varphi)}})}^{\mathcal{T}}{({\mathbf{R}_{z}{(\lambda)}})}^{\mathcal{T}},} & {(2.124)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /φ/ = arccos(

${\widehat{n}}_{z}$

) and /λ/ = arctan(

${\widehat{n}}_{y},{\widehat{n}}_{x}$

).

A procedure for making the rotation matrix is:

<<p184>>

{% highlight scheme %} (define (angle-axis->rotation-matrix theta n)
(let ((nx (ref n 0)) (ny (ref n 1)) (nz (ref n 2))) (let ((colatitude
(acos nz)) (longitude (atan ny nx))) (* (Rz-matrix longitude) (Ry-matrix
colatitude) (Rz-matrix theta) (transpose (Ry-matrix colatitude))
(transpose (Rz-matrix longitude)))))) {% endhighlight %}

And a procedure for obtaining the angle and axis of a quaternion is

{% highlight scheme %} (define (quaternion->angle-axis q) (let* ((v
(quaternion->3vector q)) (theta (* 2 (atan (euclidean-norm v)
(quaternion->real-part q)))) (axis (/ v (euclidean-norm v)))) (list
theta axis))) {% endhighlight %}

Combining these, we can compute the rotation matrix associated with a
quaternion:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (quaternion->RM q) (let ((aa
(quaternion->angle-axis q))) (let ((theta (ref aa 0)) (n (ref aa 1)))
(angle-axis->rotation-matrix theta n)))) {% endhighlight %}

The resulting matrix has the square of the magnitude of the quaternion
dividing each term. For a unit quaternion this denominator has no
effect, but the expression looks simpler if we multiply through:

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression (let ((v (up 'q_0 'q_1 'q_2
'q_3))) (let ((m^2 (dot-product v v))) (* m^2 (quaternion->RM
(make-quaternion v)))))) {% endhighlight %}

$$\begin{pmatrix}
{q_{0}^{2} + q_{1}^{2} - q_{2}^{2} - q_{3}^{2}} & {- 2q_{0}q_{3} + 2q_{1}q_{2}} & {2q_{0}q_{2} + 2q_{1}q_{3}} \\
{2q_{0}q_{3} + 2q_{1}q_{2}} & {q_{0}^{2} - q_{1}^{2} + q_{2}^{2} - q_{3}^{2}} & {- 2q_{0}q_{1} + 2q_{2}q_{3}} \\
{- 2q_{0}q_{2} + 2q_{1}q_{3}} & {2q_{0}q_{1} + 2q_{2}q_{3}} & {q_{0}^{2} - q_{1}^{2} - q_{2}^{2} + q_{3}^{2}} \\
\end{pmatrix}$$

We then capture this result as a useful procedure (dividing through by
the square of the magnitude). The resulting matrix is homogeneous
<<p185>>of degree zero in the quaternion components, so the result is
insensitive to the scale.

{% highlight scheme %} (define (quaternion->rotation-matrix q) (let ((q0
(quaternion-ref q 0)) (q1 (quaternion-ref q 1)) (q2 (quaternion-ref q
2)) (q3 (quaternion-ref q 3))) (let ((m^2 (+ (expt q0 2) (expt q1 2)
(expt q2 2) (expt q3 2)))) (/ (matrix-by-rows (list (- (+ (expt q0 2)
(expt q1 2)) (+ (expt q2 2) (expt q3 2))) (* 2 (- (* q1 q2) (* q0 q3)))
(* 2 (+ (* q1 q3) (* q0 q2)))) (list (* 2 (+ (* q1 q2) (* q0 q3))) (- (+
(expt q0 2) (expt q2 2)) (+ (expt q1 2) (expt q3 2))) (* 2 (- (* q2 q3)
(* q0 q1)))) (list (* 2 (- (* q1 q3) (* q0 q2))) (* 2 (+ (* q2 q3) (* q0
q1))) (- (+ (expt q0 2) (expt q3 2)) (+ (expt q1 2) (expt q2 2)))))
m^2)))) {% endhighlight %}

Next we determine the components of the angular velocity on the body
using this result and the M->omega-body of
[[file:chapter002.html#h1-8][section 2.2]]:

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression ((M->omega-body (compose
quaternion->rotation-matrix make-quaternion)) (up 't (up 'q_0 'q_1 'q_2
'q_3) (up 'qdot_0 'qdot_1 'qdot_2 'qdot_3)))) {% endhighlight %}

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{2q_{0}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{1} - 2q_{1}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{0} - 2q_{2}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{3} + 2q_{3}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{2}}{q_{0}^{2} + q_{1}^{2} + q_{2}^{2} + q_{3}^{2}} \\
\frac{2q_{0}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{2} + 2q_{1}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{3} - 2q_{2}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{0} - 2q_{3}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{1}}{q_{0}^{2} + q_{1}^{2} + q_{2}^{2} + q_{3}^{2}} \\
\frac{2q_{0}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{3} - 2q_{1}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{2} + 2q_{2}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{1} - 2q_{3}{\overset{˙}{q}}_{0}}{q_{0}^{2} + q_{1}^{2} + q_{2}^{2} + q_{3}^{2}} \\
\end{pmatrix}$$

The result is simple (ignoring the denominators, which have value 1 for
unit quaternions). Note that this result is not, on the surface,
independent of the scale of the quaternion. But since the
<<p186>>quaternion is representing the orientation of a rotating body it
is a function of time. So the time derivative of the quaternion must
scale as the quaternion scales: in this sense the formula is independent
of scale.

But we can write this in an even simpler way. Notice that the numerators
are linear in both the

${\overset{˙}{q}}_{i}$

and /q_{j}/. We can invent matrices that perform the relevant
combinations. Introduce

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{i} = \left( \begin{array}{llll}
0 & {+ 1} & 0 & 0 \\
{- 1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & {- 1} \\
0 & 0 & {+ 1} & 0 \\
\end{array} \right)} & \\
{\mathbf{j} = \left( \begin{array}{llll}
0 & 0 & {+ 1} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & {+ 1} \\
{- 1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & {- 1} & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array} \right)} & \\
{\mathbf{k} = \left( \begin{array}{llll}
0 & 0 & 0 & {+ 1} \\
0 & 0 & {- 1} & 0 \\
0 & {+ 1} & 0 & 0 \\
{- 1} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array} \right).} & \left( 2.125 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

In terms of these matrices, we can write the angular velocity on the
body more simply, given a unit quaternion

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\omega^{a} = {{2\mathcal{q}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{i}\overset{˙}{\mathcal{q}}}/\left\| \mathcal{q} \right\|^{2}}} & \\
{\omega^{b} = {{2\mathcal{q}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{j}\overset{˙}{\mathcal{q}}}/\left\| \mathcal{q} \right\|^{2}}} & \\
{\omega^{c} = {{2\mathcal{q}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{k}\overset{˙}{\mathcal{q}}}/{\left\| \mathcal{q} \right\|^{2},}}} & \left( 2.126 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

where

$\mathcal{q}$

is a column matrix of the components of /q/. As a program:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (quaternion-state->omega-body s) (let ((q
(coordinates s)) (qdot (velocities s))) (let ((m^2 (dot-product q q)))
(let ((omega^a (/ (* 2 (dot-product q (* q:i qdot))) m^2)) (omega^b (/
(* 2 (dot-product q (* q:j qdot))) m^2)) (omega^c (/ (* 2 (dot-product q
(* q:k qdot))) m^2))) (up omega^a omega^b omega^c))))) {% endhighlight
%}

where q:i, q:j, and q:k implement *i*, *j*, and *k*.

<<p187>>

The antisymmetric matrices *i*, *j*, and *k* have interesting algebraic
properties:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{i}^{2} = \mathbf{j}^{2} = \mathbf{k}^{2} = \mathbf{ijk} = - \mathbf{1},} & \left( 2.127 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where *1* is the 4 × 4 unit matrix.

If we forget that these are matrices, and just use the algebraic
properties of *i*, *j*, and *k* we get the “imaginary number”
representation invented by Hamilton.

** *Composition of rotations*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: composition-of-rotations
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
What is the quaternion that represents the composition of two rotations?

{% highlight scheme %} (let ((q (quaternion 'q_0 'q_1 'q_2 'q_3)) (p
(quaternion 'p_0 'p_1 'p_2 'p_3))) (let ((Mq
(quaternion->rotation-matrix q)) (Mp (quaternion->rotation-matrix p)))
(rotation-matrix->quaternion (* Mq Mp)))) {% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, the result is messy because each component is scaled by a
factor of ‖/q/‖‖/p/‖, which is 1 for unit quaternions. For each rotation
matrix there are many quaternions that can represent it. Indeed, a
quaternion scaled by any nonzero number represents the same rotation
matrix. So the process of choosing a quaternion to represent that matrix
picks a unit quaternion. Here are the components of the chosen
quaternion, eliminating the normalizing factor ‖/q/‖‖/p/‖:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\left( \begin{array}{l}
{p_{0}q_{0} - p_{1}q_{1} - p_{2}q_{2} - p_{3}q_{3}} \\
{p_{0}q_{1} + p_{1}q_{0} - p_{2}q_{3} + p_{3}q_{2}} \\
{p_{0}q_{2} + p_{1}q_{3} + p_{2}q_{0} - p_{3}q_{1}} \\
{p_{0}q_{3} - p_{1}q_{2} + p_{2}q_{1} + p_{3}q_{0}} \\
\end{array} \right).} & \left( 2.128 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The first component, the real part of the resulting quaternion, can be
interpreted as

$$\begin{matrix}
{r_{0} = q_{0}p_{0} - \upsilon_{q} \cdot \upsilon_{p},} & \left( 2.129 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

where /v_{p}/ = (/p/_{1}, /p/_{2}, /p/_{3}) and /v_{q}/ = (/q/_{1},
/q/_{2}, /q/_{3}) are the 3-vector parts of the quaternions /p/ and /q/.
The remaining three components can be interpreted as:

$$\begin{matrix}
{v_{r} = q_{0}v_{p} + p_{0}v_{q} + v_{q} \times v_{p}.} & \left( 2.130 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p188>>

We take this to specify the product of two quaternions, whether or not
they are unit quaternions. This extension of multiplicaton to non-unit
quaternions works because we did not include the normalization factors.

Each quaternion has a matrix representation in terms of the matrices
*i*, *j*, *k*, and *1*, the /quaternion units/:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{q} = q_{0}1 + q_{1}\mathbf{i} + q_{2}\mathbf{j} + q_{3}\mathbf{k}.} & \left( 2.131 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can use this representation to write our result as a matrix product:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{qp}.} & \left( 2.132 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

The elements of the top row of the matrix *r* are the components of the
quaternion /r/.

It turns out that the rotation matrix corresponding to a unit quaternion
can also be written in terms of *i*, *j*, and *k*. Let *M* be a rotation
matrix corresponding to the unit quaternion /p/. A vector with component
3-tuple *w* can be rotated by multiplication by *M* on the left. We can
perform the same operation using the quaternion units. Let /q_{w}/ be
the quaternion whose real part is 0 and whose 3-vector part is *w*, then
the product /pq_{w}p/^{∗} is a quaternion whose 3-vector part is the
rotated vector and whose real part is zero. The conjugate /p/^{∗} is
obtained from /p/ by reversing the sign of the 3-vector part. As an
equation:

$\mathbf{Mw} = \upsilon_{pq_{w}p*}.$

*** *2.12.1 Motion in Terms of Quaternions*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_2-12-1
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
Quaternions give us nice coordinates that do not suffer from the
singularities of Euler angles. So we can make use of them to compute
motions of a rigid body without needing to worry about the
singularities.

We have computed the body components of the angular velocities from a
state consisting of quaternion components and the rates of change of
those components (see equation
[[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.126][2.126]]). We can invert <<p189>>these
to find the rates of change of the quaternion components in terms of the
angular velocities and the quaternion components. The result of this
inversion is:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\overset{˙}{q} = - \frac{1}{2}\left( {\omega^{a}\mathbf{i} + \omega^{b}\mathbf{j} + \omega^{c}\mathbf{k}} \right)\mathcal{q}.} & \left( 2.133 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

This set of differential equations is driven by Euler's equations for
the motion of the body components of the angular velocity (see equations
[[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.69][2.69]] on
[[file:chapter002.html#p153][page 153]]).^{[[#endnote_24][24]]}

We construct a system derivative for the free rigid body with mixed
coordinates. The configuration is represented by a quaternion that
specifies the rotation that takes the body from the reference
orientation to the actual orientation. The rate of change of the
configuration is specified by the components of the angular velocities
on the body.

{% highlight scheme %} (define (qw-sysder A B C) (let ((B-C/A (/ (- B C)

qdot omegadot))))) the-deriv)) {% endhighlight %}

<<p190>>

Note that this system derivative is not constructed by an automatic
process: this was not derived from a Lagrangian. This is part of the
price we pay for using redundant coordinates (the four quaternion
components) to represent the configuration of a system with only three
degrees of freedom. By using Euler's equations we avoid having to
eliminate the constraint. However, the computations with quaternions are
easier than the ones using Euler angles, because they do not involve
evaluating transcendental functions or avoiding the singularities.

Since we will monitor the errors in the conserved quantities, angular
momentum and energy, we need to compute these quantites from the state.
The kinetic energy and the angular momentum components on the body are
exactly the same as we used before, because they depend on only the
components of the angular velocities on the body. However, to get the
components of the angular momentum on spatial axes we need the rotation
computed from the quaternion coordinates:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((qw-state->L-space A B C) qw-state) (let
((q (coordinates qw-state))) (let ((Lbody ((L-body A B C) (ref qw-state
2))) (M (quaternion->rotation-matrix (make-quaternion q)))) (* Lbody
(transpose M))))) {% endhighlight %}

From the initial angular momentum and energy we can compute the relative
error of these quantities, as we did in
[[file:chapter002.html#h3_2-8-1][section 2.8.1]]:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((monitor-errors win A B C L0 E0)
qw-state) (let ((t (time qw-state)) (L ((qw-state->L-space A B C)
qw-state)) (E ((T-body A B C) (ref qw-state 2)))) (plot-point win t
(relative-error (ref L 0) (ref L0 0))) (plot-point win t (relative-error
(ref L 1) (ref L0 1))) (plot-point win t (relative-error (ref L 2) (ref
L0 2))) (plot-point win t (relative-error E E0)) qw-state)) {%
endhighlight %}

Below we set up the initial conditions and use monitor-errors to plot
the errors. We use the same initial conditions that we did for Euler
angles. We get the rotation matrix M that transforms the reference
position to the initial Euler state and use that to construct the
equivalent quaternion state for this evolution.

{% highlight scheme %} (define win (frame 0.0 100.0 -1.0e-13 1.0e-13))
(let* ((A 1.0) (B (sqrt 2.0)) (C 2.0) ; moments of inertia (Euler-state
(up 0.0 ; initial state (up 1.0 0.0 0.0) (up 0.1 0.1 0.1))) (M (Euler->M
(coordinates Euler-state))) (q (quaternion->vector
(rotation-matrix->quaternion M))) (qw-state0 (up (time Euler-state) q
(Euler-state->omega-body Euler-state)))) (let ((L0 ((qw-state->L-space A
B C) qw-state0)) (E0 ((T-body A B C) (ref qw-state0 2)))) ((evolve
qw-sysder A B C) qw-state0 (monitor-errors win A B C L0 E0) 0.1 ; step
between plotted points 100.0 ; final time 1.0e-12))) {% endhighlight %}

[[#Fig_2-15][Figure 2.15]] shows the relative errors in the energy and
the spatial components of the angular momentum that arise in this
integration. It is interesting to note that the errors incurred by
integrating using Euler angles and quaternions are about a factor of ten
smaller than the ones that appear when the coordinates are Euler angles.

* *2.13 Summary*
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
A rigid body is an example of a mechanical system with constraints.
Thus, in a sense this chapter on rigid bodies was nothing but an
extended example of the application of the ideas developed in the first
chapter. The equations of motion are just the Lagrange equations.

The kinetic energy for a rigid body separates into a translational
kinetic energy and a rotational kinetic energy. The center of mass plays
a special role in this separation. The rotational kinetic energy is
simply expressed in terms of the inertia tensor and the angular velocity
vector. We developed the expressions for the kinetic energy that take
into account the body constraints, and we expressed the remaining
degrees of freedom in terms of suitable generalized coordinates.

<<p192>>

#+caption: *Figure 2.15* The relative errors in energy and in the three
spatial components of the angular momentum versus time. The equations
were integrated with quality-controlled 4th-order Runge--Kutta.
[[file:images/Art_P581.jpg]]

The vector angular momentum is conserved if there are no external
torques. The time derivative of the body components of the angular
momentum can be written entirely in terms of the body components of the
angular momentum, and the three principal moments of inertia. The body
components of angular momentum form a self-contained dynamical
subsystem.

One choice for generalized coordinates is the Euler angles. They form
suitable generalized coordinates, but are otherwise not special or well
motivated. The Lagrange equations for the Euler angles are singular for
some Euler angles. Other choices of generalized coordinates like the
Euler angles have similar problems. Equations of motion using
quaternions are nonsingular.

In general the potential energy depends on the details of the mass
distribution, and does not separate as the kinetic energy separated into
center of mass and relative contributions.

For an axisymmetric top with uniform gravitational acceleration, the
potential energy is exactly the potential energy due to elevation of the
center of mass. Aspects of the motion of the top <<p193>>are deduced
from the conserved quantities. Euler angles are just the right thing for
this problem.

For other problems, such as the rotational motion of an out-of-round
satellite near a planet, the potential energy cannot be written in
finite terms, and judicious approximations must be made. The essential
character of such diverse systems as the rotation of the Moon, Hyperion,
and Mercury are captured by a simple model problem.

*Exercise 2.20: Free rigid body*

Write and demonstrate a program that reproduces diagrams like
[[file:chapter002.html#Fig_2-3][figure 2.3]]
([[file:chapter002.html#h3_2-8-2][section 2.8.2]]). Can you find
trajectories that are asymptotic to the unstable relative equilibrium on
the intermediate principal axis?

*Exercise 2.21: Rotation of Mercury*

In the '60s it was discovered that Mercury has a rotation period that is
precisely 2/3 times its orbital period. We can see this resonant
behavior in the spin-orbit model problem, and we can also play with
nudging Mercury a bit to see how far off the rotation rate can be and
still be trapped in this spin-orbit resonance. If the mismatch in
angular velocity is too great, Mercury's rotation is no longer
resonantly locked to its orbit. Set /ϵ/ = 0.026 and /e/ = 0.2.

*a.* Write a program for the spin-orbit problem so this resonance
dynamics can be investigated numerically. You will need to know (or,
better, show!) that /f/ satisfies the equation

$$\begin{matrix}
{Df\left( t \right) = n\left( {1 - e^{2}} \right)^{1/2}\left( \frac{a}{R\left( t \right)} \right)^{2},} & \left( 2.134 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

with

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{a}{R\left( t \right)} = \frac{1 + e\,\cos\, f\left( t \right)}{1 - e^{2}}.} & \left( 2.135 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

Notice that /n/ disappears from the equations if they are written in
terms of a new independent variable /τ/ = /nt/. Also notice that /a/ and
/R/(/t/) appear only in the combination /a/R/(/t/).

*b.* Show that the 3:2 resonance is stable by numerically integrating
the system when the rotation is not exactly in resonance and observing
that the angle

$\theta - \frac{3}{2}nt$

oscillates.

*c.* Find the range of initial

$\overset{˙}{\theta}$

for which this resonance angle oscillates.

[[#endnote_ref_1][^{1}]]We put a rubber band or string around the book
so that it does not open.

[[#endnote_ref_2][^{2}]]For an elementary geometric proof see Whittaker
[[[file:bibliography.html#bib_46][46]]], p. 2.

[[#endnote_ref_3][^{3}]]Remember, an orthogonal matrix *R* satisfies

$\mathbf{R}^{\mathcal{T}}$

= *R*^{−1} and det *R* = 1.

[[#endnote_ref_4][^{4}]]The last equality follows from the fact that the
rotation of two vectors preserves the dot product:

$\overset{\rightarrow}{x} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{y} = \left( {R\overset{\rightarrow}{x}} \right) \cdot \left( {R\overset{\rightarrow}{y}} \right)$

, or

$\left( {R^{- 1}\overset{\rightarrow}{x}} \right) \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{y} = \overset{\rightarrow}{x} \cdot \left( {R\overset{\rightarrow}{y}} \right)$

.

[[#endnote_ref_5][^{5}]]We take a 1-by-1 matrix as a number.

[[#endnote_ref_6][^{6}]]That the inertia tensor transforms in this
manner could have been deduced from its definition
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.24][2.24]]). However, it seems that the
argument based on the coordinate-system independence of the kinetic
energy provides insight.

[[#endnote_ref_7][^{7}]]If two eigenvalues are not distinct then linear
combinations of the associated eigenvectors are eigenvectors. This gives
us the freedom to find linear combinations of the eigenvectors that are
orthonormal.

[[#endnote_ref_8][^{8}]]We expect that for each constant of the motion
we reduce by one the dimension of the region of the state space explored
by a trajectory. This is because a constant of the motion can be used
locally to solve for one of the state variables in terms of the others.

[[#endnote_ref_9][^{9}]]Systems of ODEs that satisfy a Lipschitz
condition have unique solutions.

[[#endnote_ref_10][^{10}]]The deviation of the angular momentum from the
principal axis may be due to a number of effects: earthquakes,
atmospheric tides, ... .

[[#endnote_ref_11][^{11}]]Here we are using the column-matrix version of
the components of the angular momentum, as in equation
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.52][2.52]]).

[[#endnote_ref_12][^{12}]]Rotating the cross product of two vectors
gives the same vector as is obtained by taking the cross product of two
rotated vectors:

$R\left( {\overset{\rightarrow}{u} \times \overset{\rightarrow}{\upsilon}} \right) = \left( {R\overset{\rightarrow}{u}} \right) \times \left( {R\overset{\rightarrow}{\upsilon}} \right)$

.

[[#endnote_ref_13][^{13}]]In this equation we have a partial derivative
with respect to a component of the coordinate argument of the potential
energy function. The first subscript on the ∂ symbol indicates the
coordinate argument. The second one selects the /φ/ component.

[[#endnote_ref_14][^{14}]]That the axisymmetric top can be solved in
Euler angles is, no doubt, the reason for the traditional choice of the
definition of these. For other problems, the Euler angles may offer no
particular advantage.

[[#endnote_ref_15][^{15}]]Here, we do not require that /C/ be larger
than /A/ = /B/, because they are not measured with respect to the center
of mass.

[[#endnote_ref_16][^{16}]]Traditionally, evaluating a definite integral
is known as performing a quadrature.

[[#endnote_ref_17][^{17}]]The Legendre polynomials /P_{l}/ may be
obtained by expanding the expression (1 + /y/^{2} − 2/yx/)^{−1/2} as a
power series in /y/. The coefficient of /y^{l}/ is /P_{l}/(/x/). The
first few Legendre polynomials are: /P/_{0}(/x/) = 1, /P/_{1}(/x/) =
/x/,

$P_{2}\left( x \right) = \frac{3}{2}x^{2} - \frac{1}{2}$

, and so on. The rest satisfy the recurrence relation

/lP_{l}/(/x/) = (2/l/ − 1)/xP/_{/l/−1}(/x/) − (/l/ − 1)/P/_{/l/−2}(/x/).

[[#endnote_ref_18][^{18}]]This approximate representation of the
potential energy is sometimes called MacCullagh's formula.

[[#endnote_ref_19][^{19}]]Traditionally, the point in the orbit at which
the two bodies are closest is called the /pericenter/ and the angle /f/
is called the /true anomaly/.

[[#endnote_ref_20][^{20}]]The given potential energy differs from the
actual potential energy in that non-constant terms that do not depend on
/θ/ and consequently do not affect the evolution of /θ/ have been
dropped.

[[#endnote_ref_21][^{21}]]Traditionally, the orbital angular frequency
is called the /mean motion/.

[[#endnote_ref_22][^{22}]]Deriving the coefficients is a matter of
celestial mechanics;

$A_{m}\left( e \right) = X_{2}^{- 3,2}\left( e \right)$

where

$X_{k}^{i,j}\left( e \right)$

are called Hansen functions. They are written as power series in
eccentricity.

[[#endnote_ref_23][^{23}]]This method of /averaging/ is rather vague; we
will justify it later when we study perturbation theory.

[[#endnote_ref_24][^{24}]]We could incorporate external torques by using
the augmented Euler's equations
([[file:chapter002.html#disp_2.83][2.83]]).
