  We have done considerable mountain climbing. Now we are in the

  a high plateau on which geometry, optics, mechanics, and wave
  mechanics meet on common ground. Only concentrated thinking, and a

One way to simplify the analysis of a problem is to express it in a form
in which the solution has a simple representation. However, it may not
be easy to formulate the problem in such a way initially. It is often
useful to start by formulating the problem in one way, and then
transform it. For example, the formulation of the problem of the motion
of a number of gravitating bodies is simple in rectangular coordinates,
but it is easier to understand aspects of the motion in terms of orbital
elements, such as the semimajor axes, eccentricities, and inclinations
of the orbits. The semimajor axis and eccentricity of an orbit depend on
both the configuration and the velocity of the body. Such
transformations are more general than those that express changes in
configuration coordinates. Here we investigate transformations of
phase-space coordinates that involve both the generalized coordinates
and the generalized momenta.

Suppose we have two different Hamiltonian systems, and suppose the
trajectories of the two systems are in one-to-one correspondence. In
this case both Hamiltonian systems can be mathematical models of the
same physical system. Some questions about the physical system may be
easier to answer by reference to one model and others may be easier to
answer in the other model. For example, it may be easier to formulate
the physical system in one model and to discover a conserved quantity in
the other. Canonical transformations are maps between Hamiltonian
systems that preserve the dynamics.

<<p336>>

A /canonical transformation/ is a phase-space coordinate transformation
and an associated transformation of the Hamiltonian such that the
dynamics given by Hamilton's equations in the two representations
describe the same evolution of the system.

* *5.1 Point Transformations*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-29
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
A /point transformation/ is a canonical transformation that extends a
possibly time-dependent transformation of the configuration coordinates
to a phase-space transformation. For example, one might want to
reexpress motion in terms of polar coordinates, given a description in
terms of rectangular coordinates. In order to extend a transformation of
the configuration coordinates to a phase-space transformation we must
specify how the momenta and Hamiltonian are transformed.

We have already seen how coordinate transformations can be carried out
in the Lagrangian formulation (see
[[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-1][section 1.6.1]]). In that case, we
found that if the Lagrangian transforms by composition with the
coordinate transformation, then the Lagrange equations are equivalent.

Lagrangians that differ by the addition of a total time derivative have
the same Lagrange equations, but may have different momenta conjugate to
the generalized coordinates. So there is more than one way to make a
canonical extension of a coordinate transformation.

Here, we find the particular canonical extension of a coordinate
transformation for which the Lagrangians transform by composition with
the transformation, with no extra total time derivative terms added to
the Lagrangian.

Let /L/ be a Lagrangian for a system. Consider the coordinate
transformation /q/ = /F/ (/t/, /q/′). The velocities transform by

$$\begin{matrix}
{v = \partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right) + \partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)v\prime.} & {(5.1)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

We obtain a Lagrangian /L/′ in the transformed coordinates by
composition of /L/ with the coordinate transformation. We require that
/L/′(/t/, /q/′, /v/′) = /L/(/t/, /q/, /v/), so:

$$\begin{matrix}
\begin{matrix}
{L\prime\left( {t,q\prime,v\prime} \right) = L\left( {t,F\left( {t,q\prime} \right),\partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right) + \partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)v\prime} \right).} & {(5.2)} \\
\end{matrix} \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p337>>

The momentum conjugate to /q/′ is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{p\prime} & {= \partial_{2}L\prime\left( {t,q\prime,v\prime} \right)} & \\
 & {= \partial_{2}L\left( {t,F\left( {t,q\prime} \right),\partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right) + \partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)v\prime} \right)\partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)} & \\
 & {= p\partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right),} & {(5.3)} \\
\end{array}$$

where we have used

$$\begin{array}{lll}
p & {= \partial_{2}L\left( {t,q,v} \right)} & \\
 & {= \partial_{2}L\left( {t,F\left( {t,q\prime} \right),\partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right) + \partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)v\prime} \right).} & {(5.4)} \\
\end{array}$$

So, from equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.3][5.3]]),^{[[#endnote_1][1]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = p\prime\left( {\partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)} \right)^{- 1}.} & {(5.5)} \\
\end{array}$$

We can collect these results to define a canonical phase-space
transformation /C/_{H}:^{[[#endnote_2][2]]}

$$\begin{array}{lll}
\left( {t,q,p} \right) & {= C_{\text{H}}\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right)} & \\
 & {= (t,F(t,q\prime),p\prime{(\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime))}^{- 1}).} & {(5.6)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Hamiltonian is obtained by the Legendre transform

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = p\prime v\prime - L\prime\left( {t,q\prime,v\prime} \right)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = (p\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime))((\partial_{1}F{(t,q\prime)}^{- 1}(v - \partial_{0}F(t,q\prime)))) - L(t,q,v)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = pv - L(t,q,v) - p\partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = H(t,q,p) - p\partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right),} & {(5.7)} \\
\end{array}$$

using relations ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.1][5.1]]) and
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.3][5.3]]) in the second step. Fully
expressed in terms of the transformed coordinates and momenta, the
transformed <<p338>>Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H\prime\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right) =} & {H(t,F(t,q\prime),p\prime{(\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime))}^{- 1})} & \\
 & {- (p\prime{(\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime))}^{- 1})\partial_{0}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right).} & {(5.8)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Hamiltonians /H/′ and /H/ are equivalent because /L/ and /L/′ have
the same value for a given dynamical state and so have the same paths of
stationary action. In general /H/ and /H/′ do not have the same values
for a given dynamical state, but differ by a term that depends on the
coordinate transformation.

For time-independent transformations, ∂_{0}/F/ = 0, there are a number
of simplifications. The relationship of the velocities
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.1][5.1]]) becomes

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{v = \partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)v\prime.} & {(5.9)} \\
\end{array}$$

Comparing this to the relation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.5][5.5]])
between the momenta, we see that in this case the momenta transform
“oppositely” to the velocities^{[[#endnote_3][3]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{pv = p\prime\left( {\partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)} \right)^{- 1}\partial_{1}F\left( {t,q\prime} \right)v\prime = p\prime v\prime,} & {(5.10)} \\
\end{array}$$

so the product of the momenta and the velocities is not changed by the
transformation. This, combined with the fact that by construction
/L/(/t/, /q/, /v/) = /L/′(/t/, /q/′, /v/′), shows that

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H(t,q,p)} & {= pv - L(t,q,v)} & \\
 & {= p\prime v\prime - L\prime\left( {t,q\prime,v\prime} \right)} & \\
 & {= H\prime\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right).} & {(5.11)} \\
\end{array}$$

For time-independent coordinate transformations the Hamiltonian
transforms by composition with the associated phase-space
transformation. We can also see this from the general relationship
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.7][5.7]]) between the Hamiltonians.

The procedure F->CH takes a procedure F implementing a transformation of
configuration coordinates and returns a procedure implementing a
transformation of phase-space coordinates:^{[[#endnote_4][4]]}

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((F->CH F) state) (up (time state) (F
state) (solve-linear-right (momentum state) (((partial 1) F) state))))
{% endhighlight %}

Consider a particle moving in a central field. In rectangular
coordinates a Hamiltonian is

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((H-central m V) state) (let ((x
(coordinate state)) (p (momentum state))) (+ (/ (square p) (* 2 m)) (V
(sqrt (square x)))))) {% endhighlight %}

Let's look at this Hamiltonian in polar coordinates. The phase-space
transformation is obtained by applying F->CH to the procedure p->r that
takes a time and a polar tuple and returns a tuple of rectangular
coordinates (see [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-1][section 1.6.1]]). The
transformation is time independent so the Hamiltonian transforms by
composition. In polar coordinates the Hamiltonian is

{% highlight scheme %} (show-expression ((compose (H-central 'm
(literal-function 'V)) (F->CH p->r)) (up 't (up 'r 'phi) (down 'p_r
'p_phi)))) {% endhighlight %}

$$V(r) + \frac{\frac{1}{2}p_{r}^{2}}{m} + \frac{\frac{1}{2}p_{\varphi}^{2}}{mr^{2}}$$

There are three terms. There is the potential energy, which depends on
the radius, there is the kinetic energy due to radial motion, and there
is the kinetic energy due to tangential motion. As expected, the angle
/φ/ does not appear and thus the angular momentum <<p340>>is a conserved
quantity. By going to polar coordinates we have decoupled one of the two
degrees of freedom in the problem.

If the transformation is time varying the Hamiltonian must be adjusted
by adding a correction to the composition of the Hamiltonian and the
transformation (see equation [[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.8][5.8]]):

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime = H \circ C_{\text{H}} + K} & {(5.12)} \\
\end{array}$$

The correction is computed by

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((F->K F) state) (- (*
(solve-linear-right (momentum state) (((partial 1) F) state)) (((partial
0) F) state)))) {% endhighlight %}

For example, consider a transformation to coordinates translating with
velocity /v/:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((translating v) state) (+ (coordinates
state) (* v (time state)))) {% endhighlight %}

We compute the additive adjustment required for the Hamiltonian:

{% highlight scheme %} ((F->K (translating (up 'v^x 'v^y 'v^z))) (up 't
(up 'x 'y 'z) (down 'p_x 'p_y 'p_z))) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (+ (* -1 p_x v^x) (* -1 p_y v^y) (* -1 p_z v^z))
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that this is the negation of the inner product of the momentum
and the velocity of the coordinate system.

Let's see how a simple free-particle Hamiltonian is transformed:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((H-free m) s) (/ (square (momentum s))
(* 2 m))) {% endhighlight %}

The transformed Hamiltonian is:

{% highlight scheme %} (define H-prime (+ (compose (H-free 'm) (F->CH
(translating (up 'v^x 'v^y 'v^z)))) (F->K (translating (up 'v^x 'v^y
'v^z))))) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (H-prime (up 't (up 'xprime 'yprime 'zprime)
(down 'pprime_x 'pprime_y 'pprime_z))) (+ (* -1 pprime_x v^x) (* -1
pprime_y v^y) (* -1 pprime_z v^z) (/ (* 1/2 (expt pprime_x 2)) m) (/ (*
1/2 (expt pprime_y 2)) m) (/ (* 1/2 (expt pprime_z 2)) m)) {%
endhighlight %}

*Exercise 5.1: Galilean invariance*

Is this result what you expected? Let's investigate.

Recall that in [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-29][exercise 1.29]] we
showed that if the kinetic energy is

$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

then the translation to a uniformly moving coordinate system introduces
extra terms that can be identified as a total time derivative. Since
these terms do not affect the Lagrange equations, we can take the
kinetic energy in the transformed coordinates to also be

$\frac{1}{2}m\left( v\prime \right)^{2}$

.

Let /C/_{H} be the phase space extension of the translation
transformation, and /C/ be the local tuple extension. The transformed
Hamiltonian is /H/′ = /H/ ∘ /C/_{H} + /K/; the transformed Lagrangian is
/L/′ = /L/ ∘ /C/.

*a.* Derive the relationship between /p/ and /p/′ both from /C/_{H} and
from the Lagrangians. Are they the same? Derive the relationship between
/v/ and /v/′ by taking the derivative of the Hamiltonians with respect
to the momenta (Hamilton's equation). Show that the Legendre transform
of /L/′ gives the same /H/′.

*b.* We have shown that /L/ and /L/′ differ by a total time derivative.
So for any uniformly moving coordinate system we can write the
Lagrangian as

$\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

. Similarly, we would expect to always be able to write the Hamiltonian
as /p/^{2}/(2/m/). Show that this differs from /H/′ by a total time
derivative in the corresponding Lagrangians.

*Exercise 5.2: Rotations*

Let /q/ and /q/′ be rectangular coordinates that are related by a
rotation /R/: /q/ = /Rq/′. The Lagrangian for the system is

$L(t,q,v) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - V(q)$

. Find the corresponding phase-space transformation /C/_{H}. Compare the
transformation equations for the rectangular components of the momenta
to those for the rectangular components of the velocities. Are you
surprised, considering equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.10][5.10]])?

* *5.2 General Canonical Transformations*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-29a
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
Although we have shown how to extend any coordinate transformation of
the configuration space to a canonical transformation, there are other
ways to construct canonical transformations. How do we know if we have a
canonical transformation? To test if a transformation is canonical we
may use the fact that if the transformation is canonical, then
Hamilton's equations of motion for the transformed system and the
original system will be equivalent.

Consider a Hamiltonian /H/ and a phase-space transformation /C/_{H}. Let
/D_{s}/ be the function that takes a Hamiltonian and gives the
Hamiltonian state-space derivative:^{[[#endnote_5][5]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D_{s}H(t,q,p) = (1,\partial_{2}H(t,q,p), - \partial_{1}H(t,q,p)).} & {(5.13)} \\
\end{array}$$

Hamilton's equations are

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D\sigma = D_{s}H \circ \sigma,} & {(5.14)} \\
\end{array}$$

for any realizable phase-space path /σ/.

The transformation /C/_{H} transforms the phase-space path /σ/′ (/t/) =
(/t/, /q/′ (/t/), /p/′ (/t/)) into /σ/(/t/) = (/t/, /q/(/t/), /p/(/t/)):

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sigma = C_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime.} & {(5.15)} \\
\end{array}$$

The rates of change of the phase-space coordinates are transformed by
the derivative of the transformation

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D\sigma = D\left( {C_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime} \right) = \left( {DC_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime} \right)D\sigma\prime.} & {(5.16)} \\
\end{array}$$

The transformation is canonical if the equations of motion obtained from
the new Hamiltonian are the same as those that could be obtained by
transforming the equations of motion derived from the original
Hamiltonian to the new coordinates:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D\sigma = \left( {DC_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime} \right)D\sigma\prime = \left( {DC_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime} \right)\left( {D_{s}H\prime \circ \sigma\prime} \right).} & {(5.17)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.14][5.14]]), we see that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D_{s}H \circ \sigma = \left( {DC_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime} \right)\left( {D_{s}H\prime \circ \sigma\prime} \right).} & {(5.18)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p343>>

#+caption: *Figure 5.1* A canonical transformation /C/_{H} relates the
descriptions of a dynamical system in two phase-space coordinate
systems. The transformation shows how Hamilton's equations in one
coordinate system may be derived from Hamilton's equations in the other

[[file:images/Art_P907.jpg]]

With /σ/ = /C/_{H} ∘ /σ/′, we find

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D_{s}H \circ C_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime = \left( {DC_{\text{H}} \circ \sigma\prime} \right)\left( {D_{s}H\prime \circ \sigma\prime} \right).} & {(5.19)} \\
\end{array}$$

This condition must hold for any realizable phase-space path /σ/′.
Certainly this is true if the following condition holds for every
phase-space point:^{[[#endnote_6][6]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D_{s}H \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot D_{s}H\prime.} & {(5.20)} \\
\end{array}$$

Any transformation that satisfies equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.20][5.20]]) is a canonical transformation
among phase-space representations of a dynamical system. In one
phase-space representation the system's dynamics is characterized by the
Hamiltonian /H/′ and in the other by /H/. The idea behind this equation
is illustrated in [[file:chapter005.html#Fig_5-1][figure 5.1]].

<<p344>>

We can formalize this test as a program:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (canonical? C H Hprime) (- (compose
(Hamiltonian->state-derivative H) C) (* (D C)
(Hamiltonian->state-derivative Hprime)))) {% endhighlight %}

where Hamiltonian->state-derivative, which was introduced in chapter 3,
implements /D_{s}/. The transformation is canonical if these residuals
are zero.

For time-independent point transformations an appropriate Hamiltonian
can be formed by composition with the corresponding phase-space
transformation. For more general canonical transformations, we will see
that if a transformation is independent of time, a suitable Hamiltonian
for the transformed system can be obtained by composing the Hamiltonian
with the phase-space transformation. In this case we obtain a more
specific formula:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D_{s}H \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot D_{s}(H \circ C_{\text{H}}).} & {(5.21)} \\
\end{array}$$

The analysis of the harmonic oscillator illustrates the use of a general
canonical transformation in the solution of a problem. The harmonic
oscillator is a mathematical model of a simple spring-mass system. A
Hamiltonian for a spring-mass system with mass /m/ and spring constant
/k/ is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t,x,p_{x}) = \frac{p_{x}^{2}}{2m} + \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}.} & {(5.22)} \\
\end{array}$$

Hamilton's equations of motion are

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{Dx = {p_{x}/m}} & \\
{Dp_{x} = - kx,} & {(5.23)} \\
\end{array}$$

giving the second-order system

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{mD^{2}x + kx = 0.} & {(5.24)} \\
\end{array}$$

The solution is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x(t) = A\,\sin(\omega t + \varphi),} & {(5.25)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p345>>

where

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\omega = \sqrt{k/m}} & {(5.26)} \\
\end{array}$$

and where /A/ and /φ/ are determined by initial conditions.

We use the polar-canonical transformation:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(t,x,p_{x}) = C_{\alpha}(t,\theta,I)} & {(5.27)} \\
\end{array}$$

where

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x = \sqrt{\frac{2I}{\alpha}}\sin\,\theta} & {(5.28)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p_{x} = \sqrt{2\alpha I}\,\cos\,\theta.} & {(5.29)} \\
\end{array}$$

Here /α/ is an arbitrary parameter. We define:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((polar-canonical alpha) state) (let ((t
(time state)) (theta (coordinate state)) (I (momentum state))) (let ((x
(* (sqrt (/ (* 2 I) alpha)) (sin theta))) (p_x (* (sqrt (* 2 alpha I))
(cos theta)))) (up t x p_x)))) {% endhighlight %}

And now we just run our test:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((H-harmonic m k) s) (+ (/ (square
(momentum s)) (* 2 m)) (* 1/2 k (square (coordinate s))))) ((canonical?
(polar-canonical 'alpha) (H-harmonic 'm 'k) (compose (H-harmonic 'm 'k)
(polar-canonical 'alpha))) (up 't 'theta 'I)) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (up 0 0 0) {% endhighlight %}

So the transformation is canonical for the harmonic
oscillator.^{[[#endnote_7][7]]}

<<p346>>

Let's use our polar-canonical transformation /C_{α}/ to help us solve
the harmonic oscillator. We substitute expressions
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.28][5.28]]) and
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.29][5.29]]) for /x/ and /p_{x}/ in the
Hamiltonian, getting our new Hamiltonian:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,\theta,I) = \frac{\alpha I}{m}{(\cos\,\theta)}^{2} + \frac{kI}{\alpha}{(\sin\,\theta)}^{2}.} & {(5.30)} \\
\end{array}$$

If we choose

$\alpha = \sqrt{km}$

then we obtain

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,\theta,I) = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}I = \omega I,} & {(5.31)} \\
\end{array}$$

and the new Hamiltonian no longer depends on the coordinate. Hamilton's
equation for /I/ is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{DI(t) = - \partial_{1}H\prime(t,\theta(t),I(t)) = 0,} & {(5.32)} \\
\end{array}$$

so /I/ is constant. The equation for /θ/ is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D\theta(t) = \partial_{2}H\prime(t,\theta(t),I(t)) = \omega,} & {(5.33)} \\
\end{array}$$

so

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\theta(t) = \omega t + \varphi.} & {(5.34)} \\
\end{array}$$

In the original variables,

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{x(t)} & {= \sqrt{{2I(t)}/\alpha}\,{\sin\,\theta(t)}} & \\
 & {= A\,\sin(\omega t + \varphi),} & {(5.35)} \\
\end{array}$$

with the constant

$A = \sqrt{{2I(t)}/\alpha}$

. So we have found the solution to the problem by making a canonical
transformation to new phase-space variables for which the solution is
easy and then transforming the solutions back to the original variables.

{D_{s}H \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot D_{s}(H \circ C_{\text{H}} + K).} & {(5.39)} \\
\end{array}$$

Expanding the state derivative, the canonical condition is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(T + \mathcal{D}H) \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot (T + \mathcal{D}(H \circ C_{\text{H}} + K)).} & {(5.40)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p348>>

Equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.40][5.40]]) is satisfied if the
following conditions are met:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{D}H \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot \mathcal{D}(H \circ C_{\text{H}})} & {(5.41)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{T \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot (T + \mathcal{D}K).} & {(5.42)} \\
\end{array}$$

The value of /T/ ∘ /C/_{H} does not depend on /C/_{H}, so this term is
really very simple. Notice that equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]) does not depend upon /K/ and
that equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.42][5.42]]) does not depend
upon /H/.

These can be implemented as follows:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (canonical-H? C H) (- (compose
(D-phase-space H) C) (* (D C) (D-phase-space (compose H C))))) (define
(canonical-K? C K) (- (compose T-func C) (* (D C) (+ T-func
(D-phase-space K))))) {% endhighlight %}

Consider a time-dependent transformation to uniformly rotating
coordinates:^{[[#endnote_10][10]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = R(\Omega)\left( {t,q\prime} \right),} & {(5.43)} \\
\end{array}$$

with components

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x = x\prime\,\cos(\Omega t) - y\prime\,\sin(\Omega t)} & \\
{y = x\prime\,\sin(\Omega t) + y\prime\,\cos(\Omega t).} & {(5.44)} \\
\end{array}$$

As a program this is

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((rotating Omega) state) (let ((t (time
state)) (qp (coordinate state))) (let ((xp (ref qp 0)) (yp (ref qp 1))
(zp (ref qp 2))) (up (- (* (cos (* Omega t)) xp) (* (sin (* Omega t))
yp)) (+ (* (sin (* Omega t)) xp) (* (cos (* Omega t)) yp)) zp)))) {%
endhighlight %}

The extension of this transformation to a phase-space transformation is

{% highlight scheme %} (define (C-rotating Omega) (F->CH (rotating
Omega))) {% endhighlight %}

We first verify that this time-dependent transformation satisfies
equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]). We will try it for
an arbitrary Hamiltonian with three degrees of freedom:

{% highlight scheme %} (define H-arbitrary (literal-function 'H (-> (UP
Real (UP Real Real Real) (DOWN Real Real Real)) Real))) ((canonical-H?
(C-rotating 'Omega) H-arbitrary) (up 't (up 'xp 'yp 'zp) (down 'pp_x
'pp_y 'pp_z))) (up 0 (up 0 0 0) (down 0 0 0)) {% endhighlight %}

And it works. Note that this result did not depend on any details of the
Hamiltonian, suggesting that we might be able to make a test that does
not require a Hamiltonian. We will see that shortly.

Since we have a point transformation, we can compute the required
adjustment to the Hamiltonian:

{% highlight scheme %} ((F->K (rotating 'Omega)) (up 't (up 'xp 'yp 'zp)
(down 'pp_x 'pp_y 'pp_z))) (+ (* Omega pp_x yp) (* -1 Omega pp_y xp)) {%
endhighlight %}

So, for this transformation an appropriate correction to the Hamiltonian
is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{K(\Omega)\left( {t;x\prime,y\prime,z\prime;p_{x}^{\prime},p_{y}^{\prime},p_{z}^{\prime}} \right) = - \Omega\left( {x\prime p_{y}^{\prime} - y\prime p_{x}^{\prime}} \right),} & {(5.45)} \\
\end{array}$$

which is minus the rate of rotation of the coordinate system multiplied
by the angular momentum. We implement /K/ as a procedure

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((K Omega) s) (let ((qp (coordinate s))
(pp (momentum s))) (let ((xp (ref qp 0)) (yp (ref qp 1)) (ppx (ref pp
0)) (ppy (ref pp 1))) (* -1 Omega (- (* xp ppy) (* yp ppx)))))) {%
endhighlight %}

and apply the test. We find:

{% highlight scheme %} ((canonical-K? (C-rotating 'Omega) (K 'Omega))
(up 't (up 'xp 'yp 'zp) (down 'pp_x 'pp_y 'pp_z))) (up 0 (up 0 0 0)
(down 0 0 0)) {% endhighlight %}

The residuals are zero so this /K/ correctly completes the canonical
transformation.

*** *5.2.2 Abstracting the Canonical Condition*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_5-2-2
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
We just saw that for the case of rotating coordinates the truth of
equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]) did not depend on
the details of the Hamiltonian. If /C/_{H} satisfies equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]) for any /H/ then we can
derive a condition on /C/_{H} that is independent of /H/.

Let's start with an expanded version of equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]):

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{D}H \circ C_{\text{H}} = DC_{\text{H}} \cdot ((\mathcal{D}H \circ C_{\text{H}}) \cdot DC_{\text{H}}),} & {(5.46)} \\
\end{array}$$

using the chain rule.

We introduce a shuffle function:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\widetilde{J}(\lbrack a,b,c\rbrack) = (0,c, - b).} & {(5.47)} \\
\end{array}$$

The argument to

$\widetilde{J}$

is a down tuple of components of the derivative of a Hamiltonian-like
function. The shuffle function is linear. Using

$\widetilde{J}$

we can write

$\mathcal{D}H = \widetilde{J} \circ DH$

.

Let /J/ be the multiplier corresponding to the constant linear function

$\widetilde{J}$

:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{J = (D\widetilde{J})(s^{\star}),} & {(5.48)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /s/^{⋆} is an arbitrary argument, shaped like /DH/(/s/), that is
compatible for multiplication with /s/. The value of /s/^{⋆} is
irrelevant because /D/

$\widetilde{J}$

is a constant function. Then we can rewrite equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.46][5.46]]) as

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{J \cdot DH(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) = DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot J \cdot (DH(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) \cdot DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime)).} & {(5.49)} \\
\end{array}$$

We can move the /DC/_{H}(/s/′) to the left of /DH/(/C/_{H}(/s/′)) by
taking its transpose:^{[[#endnote_11][11]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{J \cdot DH(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime))} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot J \cdot ({(DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot DH(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime))).} & {(5.50)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p351>>

Since

${(DC_{H}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}}$

is a linear transformation and multiplication is associative for the
multipliers of linear transformations, we can write

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{J \cdot DH(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) = DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot J \cdot {(DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot DH(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime)).} & {(5.51)} \\
\end{array}$$

This is true for any /H/ if

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{J = DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot J \cdot {(DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}}.} & {(5.52)} \\
\end{array}$$

As a program, this is^{[[#endnote_12][12]],[[#endnote_13][13]]}

{% highlight scheme %} (define (J-func DHs) (up 0 (ref DHs 2) (- (ref
DHs 1)))) (define ((canonical-transform? C) s) (let ((J ((D J-func)
(compatible-shape s))) (DCs ((D C) s))) (- J (* DCs J (transpose DCs
s))))) {% endhighlight %}

This condition, equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.52][5.52]]), on
/C/_{H}, called the /canonical condition/, does not depend on the
details of /H/. This is a remarkable result: we can decide whether a
phase-space transformation preserves the dynamics of Hamilton's
equations without further reference to the details of the dynamical
system. If the transformation is time dependent we can add a correction
to the Hamiltonian to make it canonical.

** *Examples*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: examples
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
The polar-canonical transformation satisfies the canonical condition:

{% highlight scheme %} ((canonical-transform? (polar-canonical 'alpha))
(up 't 'theta 'I)) (up (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 0)) {% endhighlight
%}

<<p352>>

But not every transformation we might try satisfies the canonical
condition. For example, we might try /x/ = /p/ sin /θ/ and /p_{x}/ = /p/
cos /θ/. The implementation is

{% highlight scheme %} (define (a-non-canonical-transform state) (let
((t (time state)) (theta (coordinate state)) (p (momentum state))) (let
((x (* p (sin theta))) (p_x (* p (cos theta)))) (up t x p_x))))
((canonical-transform? a-non-canonical-transform) (up 't 'theta 'p)) (up
(up 0 0 0) (up 0 0 (+ -1 p)) (up 0 (+ 1 (* -1 p)) 0)) {% endhighlight %}

So this transformation does not satisfy the canonical condition.

** *Canonical condition and Poisson brackets*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: canonical-condition-and-poisson-brackets
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
The canonical condition can be written simply in terms of Poisson
brackets.

The Poisson bracket can be written in terms of

$\widetilde{J}$

:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\left\{ f,g \right\} = (Df) \cdot (\widetilde{J} \circ (Dg)) = (Df) \cdot J \cdot (Dg),} & {(5.53)} \\
\end{array}$$

as can be seen by writing out the components.

We break the transformation /C/_{H} into position and momentum parts:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = A(t,q\prime,p\prime)} & {(5.54)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = B(t,q\prime,p\prime).} & {(5.55)} \\
\end{array}$$

In terms of the individual component functions, the canonical condition
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.52][5.52]]) is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\delta_{j}^{i} = \left\{ A^{i},B_{j} \right\}} & \\
{0 = \left\{ A^{i},A^{j} \right\}} & \\
{0 = \left\{ B_{i},B_{j} \right\}} & {(5.56)} \\
\end{array}$$

where

$\delta_{j}^{i}$

is 1 if /i/ = /j/ and 0 otherwise. These equations are called the
/fundamental Poisson brackets/. If a transformation satisfies these
Poisson bracket relations then it satisfies the canonical condition.

<<p353>>

We have found that a transformation is canonical if its
position-momentum part satisfies the canonical condition, but for a
time-dependent transformation we may have to modify the Hamiltonian by
the addition of a suitable /K/. We can rewrite these conditions in terms
of Poisson brackets. If the Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) = H(t,A(t,q\prime,p\prime),B(t,q\prime,p\prime)) + K(t,q\prime,p\prime),} & {(5.57)} \\
\end{array}$$

the transformation will be canonical if the coordinate-momentum
transformation satisfies the fundamental Poisson brackets, and /K/
satisfies:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\left\{ A^{i},K \right\} + \partial_{0}A^{i} = 0} & \\
{\left\{ B_{j},K \right\} + \partial_{0}B_{j} = 0.} & {(5.58)} \\
\end{array}$$

*Exercise 5.5: Poisson bracket conditions*

Fill in the details to show that the canonical condition
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.52][5.52]]) is equivalent to the
fundamental Poisson brackets ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.56][5.56]])
and that the condition on /K/ ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.42][5.42]])
is equivalent to the Poisson bracket condition on /K/
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.58][5.58]]).

** *Symplectic matrices*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: symplectic-matrices
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
It is convenient to reformulate the canonical condition in terms of
matrices. We can obtain a matrix representation of a structure with the
utility s->m that takes a structure that represents a multiplier of a
linear transformation and returns a matrix representation of the
multiplier. The procedure s->m takes three arguments: (s->m ls A rs).
The ls and rs specify the shapes of objects that multiply A on the left
and right to give a numerical value. These specify the basis. So, the
matrix representation of the multiplier corresponding to

$\widetilde{J}$

is

{% highlight scheme %} (let* ((s (up 't (up 'x 'y) (down 'px 'py))) (s*
(compatible-shape s)) (J ((D J-func) s*))) (s->m s* J s*)) {%
endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (matrix-by-rows (list 0 0 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0 1 0)
(list 0 0 0 0 1) (list 0 -1 0 0 0) (list 0 0 -1 0 0)) {% endhighlight %}

This matrix, *J*, is useful, so we supply a procedure J-matrix so that
(J-matrix n) gives this matrix for an /n/ degree-of-freedom system.

<<p354>>

We can now reexpress the canonical condition
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.52][5.52]]) as a matrix equation:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{D}\mathbf{C}_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot \mathbf{J} \cdot {(\mathbf{D}\mathbf{C}_{\text{H}}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}}.} & {(5.59)} \\
\end{array}$$

There is a further simplification available. The elements of the first
row and the first column of the matrix representation of

$\widetilde{J}$

are all zeros. This has simplifying consequences. Consider a general
transformation of phase-space states (for two degrees of freedom):

{% highlight scheme %} (define C-general (literal-function 'C (-> (UP
Real (UP Real Real) (DOWN Real Real)) (UP Real (UP Real Real) (DOWN Real
Real))))) {% endhighlight %}

Consider transformations for which the time does not depend on the
coordinates or momenta^{[[#endnote_14][14]]}

{% highlight scheme %} (define (C-simple-time s) (let ((cs (C-general
s))) (up ((literal-function 'tau) (time s)) (coordinates cs) (momenta
cs)))) {% endhighlight %}

For this kind of transformation the first row and the first column of
the residuals of the canonical-transform? test are identically zero:

{% highlight scheme %} (let* ((s (up 't (up 'x 'y) (down 'p_x 'p_y)))
(s* (compatible-shape s))) (m:nth-row (s->m s* ((canonical-transform?
C-simple-time) s) s*) 0)) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (up 0 0 0 0 0) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (let ((s (up 't (up 'x 'y) (down 'p_x 'p_y))) (s*
(compatible-shape s))) (m:nth-col (s->m s* ((canonical-transform?
C-simple-time) s) s*) 0)) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (up 0 0 0 0 0) {% endhighlight %}

<<p355>>

But for C-general these are not zero. Since the transformations we are
considering at most shift time, we need to consider only the submatrix
associated with the coordinates and the momenta.

The /qp/ submatrix^{[[#endnote_15][15]]} of dimension 2/n/ × 2/n/ of the
matrix *J* is called the /symplectic unit/ for /n/ degrees of freedom:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{J}_{n} = \left( \begin{array}{ll}
\mathbf{0}_{n \times n} & \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \\
{- \mathbf{1}_{n \times n}} & \mathbf{0}_{n \times n} \\
\end{array} \right).} & {(5.60)} \\
\end{array}$$

The matrix *J*/_{n}/ satisfies the following identities:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{J}_{n}^{\mathcal{T}} = \mathbf{J}_{n}^{- 1} = - \mathbf{J}_{n}.} & {(5.61)} \\
\end{array}$$

A 2/n/ × 2/n/ matrix *A* that satisfies the relation

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{J}_{n} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{J}_{n}\mathbf{A}^{\mathcal{T}}} & {(5.62)} \\
\end{array}$$

is called a /symplectic matrix/. We can determine whether a matrix is
symplectic:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (symplectic-matrix? M) (let ((2n
(m:dimension M))) (let ((J (symplectic-unit (quotient 2n 2)))) (- J (* M
J (transpose M)))))) {% endhighlight %}

An appropriate symplectic unit matrix of a given size is produced by the
procedure symplectic-unit.

If the matrix representation of the derivative of a transformation is a
symplectic matrix the transformation is a /symplectic transformation/.
Here is a test for whether a transformation is
symplectic:^{[[#endnote_16][16]]}

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((symplectic-transform? C) s)
(symplectic-matrix? (qp-submatrix ((D-as-matrix C) s)))) {% endhighlight
%}

<<p356>>

The procedure symplectic-transform? returns a zero matrix if and only if
the transformation being tested passes the symplectic matrix test.

For example, the point transformations are symplectic. We can show this
for a general possibly time-dependent two-degree-of-freedom point
transformation:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (F s) ((literal-function 'F (-> (X Real
(UP Real Real)) (UP Real Real))) (time s) (coordinates s)))
((symplectic-transform? (F->CH F)) (up 't (up 'x 'y) (down 'px 'py))) {%
endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (matrix-by-rows (list 0 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0 0)
(list 0 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0 0)) {% endhighlight %}

More generally, the phase-space part of the canonical condition is
equivalent to the symplectic condition (for two degrees of freedom) even
in the case of an unrestricted phase-space transformation.

{% highlight scheme %} (let* ((s (up 't (up 'x 'y) (down 'p_x 'p_y)))
(s* (compatible-shape s))) (- (qp-submatrix (s->m s*
((canonical-transform? C-general) s) s*)) ((symplectic-transform?
C-general) s))) {% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %} (matrix-by-rows (list 0 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0 0)
(list 0 0 0 0) (list 0 0 0 0)) {% endhighlight %}

*Exercise 5.6: Symplectic matrices*

Let *A* be a symplectic matrix:

$\mathbf{J}_{n} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{J}_{n}\mathbf{A}^{\mathcal{T}}$

. Show that

$\mathbf{A}^{\mathcal{T}}$

and *A*^{−1} are symplectic.

*Exercise 5.7: Polar-canonical transformations*

Let /x/, /p/ and /θ/, /I/ be two sets of canonically conjugate
variables. Consider transformations of the form /x/ = /βI^{α}/ sin /θ/
and /p/ = /βI^{α}/ cos /θ/. Determine all /α/ and /β/ for which this
transformation is symplectic.

<<p357>>

*Exercise 5.8: Standard map*

Is the standard map a symplectic transformation? Recall that the
standard map is: /I/′ = /I/ + /K/ sin /θ/, with /θ/′ = /θ/ + /I/′, both
modulo 2/π/.

*Exercise 5.9: Whittaker transform*

Shew that the transformation /q/ = log ((sin /p/′)//q/′) with /p/ = /q/′
cot /p/′ is symplectic.

Canonical transformations allow us to change the phase-space coordinate
system that we use to express a problem, preserving the form of
Hamilton's equations. If we solve Hamilton's equations in one
phase-space coordinate system we can use the transformation to carry the
solution to the other coordinate system. What other properties are
preserved by a canonical transformation?

** *Noninvariance of* /pv/
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: noninvariance-of-pv

We noted in equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.10][5.10]]) that
point transformations that are canonical extensions of time-independent
coordinate transformations preserve the value of /pv/. This does not
hold for more general canonical transformations. We can illustrate this
with the polar-canonical transformation. Along corresponding paths /x/,
/p_{x}/ and /θ/, /I/

$$\begin{array}{rll}
{x(t)} & {= \sqrt{\frac{2I(t)}{\alpha}}\sin\,\theta(t)} & \\
{p_{x}(t)} & {= \sqrt{2I(t)\alpha}\,\cos\,\theta(t),} & {(5.63)} \\
\end{array}$$

and so /Dx/ is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{Dx(t) = D\theta(t)\sqrt{\frac{2I(t)}{\alpha}}\cos\,\theta(t) + DI(t)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2I(t)\alpha}}\sin\,\theta(t).} & {(5.64)} \\
\end{array}$$

The difference of /pv/ and the transformed /p/′/v/′ is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{P_{x}(t)Dx(t) - I(t)D\theta(t)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = I(t)D\theta(t)\,(2\,{\cos}^{2}\theta(t) - 1) + DI(t)\,\sin\,\theta(t)\,\cos\,\theta(t).} & {(5.65)} \\

In general this is not zero. So the product /pv/ is not necessarily
invariant under general canonical transformations.

<<p358>>

** *Invariance of Poisson brackets*
   :PROPERTIES:

Here is a remarkable fact: the composition of the Poisson bracket of two
phase-space state functions with a canonical transformation is the same
as the Poisson bracket of each of the two functions composed with the
transformation separately. Loosely speaking, the Poisson bracket is
invariant under canonical phase-space transformations.

Let /f/ and /g/ be two phase-space state functions. Using the

$\widetilde{J}$

representation of the Poisson bracket (see
[[file:chapter005.html#h3_5-2-2][section 5.2.2]]), we deduce

$$\begin{array}{ll}

{\,\,\,\,\,\, = (Df \circ C_{\text{H}}) \cdot (\widetilde{J} \circ Dg \circ C_{\text{H}})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\, = (Df \cdot (\widetilde{J} \circ Dg)) \circ C_{\text{H}}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\, = \left\{ f,g \right\} \circ C_{\text{H}},} & {(5.66)} \\
\end{array}$$

where the fact that /C/_{H} satisfies equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]) was used in the middle. This
is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\left\{ f \circ C_{\text{H}},g \circ C_{\text{H}} \right\} = \left\{ f,g \right\} \circ C_{\text{H}}.} & {(5.67)} \\

** *Volume preservation*

/q/, /p/) = /C/_{H}(/t/, /q/′, /p/′). The function /Ĉ_{t}/ maps
phase-space coordinates to alternate phase-space coordinates at a given
time. Consider regions /R/ in (/q/, /p/) and /R/ in (/q/′, /p/′) such
that /R/ = /Ĉ_{t}/(/R/′). The volume of region /R/′ is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{V(R) = {\int_{R}\widehat{1}} = {\int_{R\prime}{\det(D{\widehat{C}}_{t}),}}} & {(5.68)} \\
\end{array}$$

where

$\widehat{1}$

is the function whose value is one for every input. Now if /C/_{H} is
symplectic then the determinant of /DĈ_{t}/ is one (see
[[file:chapter004.html#h3_4-2-3][section 4.2.3]]), so

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{V(R) = V(R\prime).} & {(5.69)} \\
\end{array}$$

Thus, phase-space volume is preserved by symplectic transformations.

<<p359>>

Liouville's theorem shows that time evolution preserves phase-space
volume. Here we see that canonical transformations also preserve phase
volumes. Later, we will find that time evolution actually generates a
canonical transformation.

Notice that the contributions for each /i/ do not mix components from
different degrees of freedom.

This bilinear form is closely related to the symplectic 2-form of
differential geometry. It differs in that the symplectic 2-form is
formally a function of the phase-space point as well as the incremental
vectors.

Under a canonical transformation /s/ = /C/_{H}(/s/′), incremental states
transform with the derivative

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\zeta_{i} = DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime)\zeta_{i}^{\prime}.} & {(5.72)} \\
\end{array}$$

We will show that the 2-form is invariant under this transformation

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\omega(\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}) = \omega(\zeta_{1}^{\prime},\zeta_{2}^{\prime}),} & {(5.73)} \\
\end{array}$$

if the time components of the

$\zeta_{i}^{\prime}$

are both zero.

We have shown that condition ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]])
does not depend on the details of the Hamiltonian /H/. So if a
transformation satisfies the canonical condition we can use condition
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.41][5.41]]) with /H/ replaced by an
arbitrary function /f/ of phase-space states:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{D}f(C_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) = (DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) \cdot (\mathcal{D}(f \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime)).} & {(5.74)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p360>>

In terms of /ω/, the Poisson bracket is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\left\{ f,g \right\}(s) = \omega(\mathcal{D}f(s),\mathcal{D}g(s))} & {(5.75)} \\
\end{array}$$

as can be seen by writing out the components. We use the fact that
Poisson brackets are invariant under canonical transformations:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(\left\{ f,g \right\} \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime) = \left\{ f \circ C_{\text{H}},g \circ C_{\text{H}} \right\}(s\prime).} & {(5.76)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using the relation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.74][5.74]]) to expand
the left-hand side of equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.76][5.76]]) we obtain:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(\left\{ f,g \right\} \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime)} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \omega((\mathcal{D}f \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime),(\mathcal{D}g \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime))} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \omega((DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) \cdot (\mathcal{D}(f \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime)),} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime)) \cdot (\mathcal{D}(g \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime))).} & {(5.77)} \\
\end{array}$$

The right-hand side of equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.76][5.76]]) is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\left\{ f \circ C_{\text{H}},g \circ C_{\text{H}} \right\}(s\prime) = \omega(\mathcal{D}(f \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime),\mathcal{D}(g \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime)).} & {(5.78)} \\
\end{array}$$

Now the left-hand side must equal the right-hand side for any /f/ and
/g/, so the equation must also be true for arbitrary

$\zeta_{i}^{\prime}$

of the form

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\zeta_{1}^{\prime} = \mathcal{D}(f \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime)} & \\
{\zeta_{2}^{\prime} = \mathcal{D}(g \circ C_{\text{H}})(s\prime).} & {(5.79)} \\
\end{array}$$

So the

$\zeta_{i}^{\prime}$

are arbitrary incremental states with zero time components.

We have proven that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\omega(\zeta_{1}^{\prime},\zeta_{2}^{\prime}) = \omega(DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot \zeta_{1}^{\prime},\, DC_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot \zeta_{2}^{\prime}).} & {(5.80)} \\
\end{array}$$

for canonical /C/_{H} and incremental states

$\zeta_{i}^{\prime}$

with zero time components. Using equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.72][5.72]]), we have

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\omega(\zeta_{1}^{\prime},\zeta_{2}^{\prime}) = \omega(\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}).} & {(5.81)} \\
\end{array}$$

Thus the bilinear antisymmetric function /ω/ is invariant under even
time-varying canonical transformations if the increments are restricted
to have zero time component.

<<p361>>

As a program, /ω/ is

{% highlight scheme %} (define (omega zeta1 zeta2) (- (* (momentum
zeta2) (coordinate zeta1)) (* (momentum zeta1) (coordinate zeta2)))) {%
endhighlight %}

On [[file:chapter005.html#p356][page 356]] we showed that point
transformations are sym-plectic. Here we can see that the 2-form is
preserved under these transformations for two degrees of freedom:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (F s) ((literal-function 'F (-> (X Real
(UP Real Real)) (UP Real Real))) (time s) (coordinates s))) (let ((s (up
't (up 'x 'y) (down 'p_x 'p_y))) (zeta1 (up 0 (up 'dx1 'dy1) (down
'dp1_x 'dp1_y))) (zeta2 (up 0 (up 'dx2 'dy2) (down 'dp2_x 'dp2_y))))
(let ((DCs ((D (F->CH F)) s))) (- (omega zeta1 zeta2) (omega (* DCs
zeta1) (* DCs zeta2))))) 0 {% endhighlight %}

Alternatively, let *z*_{1} and *z*_{2} be the matrix representations of
the /qp/ parts of /ζ/_{1} and /ζ/_{2}. The matrix representation of /ω/
is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\omega(\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}) = \mathbf{z}_{1}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot \mathbf{J}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{z}_{2}.} & {(5.82)} \\
\end{array}$$

Let *A* be the matrix representation of the /qp/ part of /DC_{H}/(/s/′)
Then the invariance of /ω/ is equivalent to

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{z}_{1}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot \mathbf{A}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot \text{J}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{z}_{2} = \mathbf{z}_{1}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot \mathbf{J}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{z}_{2}.} & {(5.83)} \\
\end{array}$$

But this is true if

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{A}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot \mathbf{J}_{n} \cdot \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{J}_{n},} & {(5.84)} \\
\end{array}$$

which is equivalent to the condition that *A* is symplectic. (If a
matrix is symplectic then its transpose is symplectic. See
[[file:chapter005.html#Exe_5-6][exercise 5.6]]).

The symplectic condition is symmetrical in that if *A* is symplec-tic
then

$\mathbf{A}^{\mathcal{T}}$

is symplectic, because the symplectic unit is invertible. The canonical
condition

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{D}\mathbf{C}_{\text{H}}(s\prime) \cdot \mathbf{J} \cdot {(\mathbf{D}\mathbf{C}_{\text{H}}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}},} & {(5.85)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p362>>

is satisfied by time-varying canonical transformations, and time-varying
canonical transformations are symplectic. But if the transformation is
time varying then

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathbf{J} = {(\mathbf{D}\mathbf{C}_{\text{H}}(s\prime))}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{D}\mathbf{C}_{\text{H}}(s\prime),} & {(5.86)} \\
\end{array}$$

is not satisfied because *J* is not invertible. Equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.86][5.86]]) is satisfied, however, for
time-independent transformations.

** *Poincaré integral invariant*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: poincaré-integral-invariant
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
The invariance of the symplectic 2-form under canonical transformations
has a simple interpretation. Consider how the area of an incremental
parallelogram in phase space transforms under canonical transformation.
Let (Δ/q/, Δ/p/) and (/δq/, /δp/) be small increments in phase space,
originating at (/q/, /p/). Consider the incremental parallelogram with
vertex at (/q/, /p/) with these two phase-space increments as edges. The
sum of the areas of the canonical projections of this incremental
parallelogram can be written

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i}{\Delta A_{i} = {\sum\limits_{i}{(\Delta q^{i}\delta p_{i} - \Delta p_{i}\delta q^{i}).}}}} & {(5.87)} \\
\end{array}$$

The right-hand side is the sum of the areas on the canonical
planes;^{[[#endnote_17][17]]} for each /i/ the area of a parallelogram
is computed from the components of the vectors defining its adjacent
sides. Let /ζ/_{1} = (0, Δ/q,/ Δ/p/) and /ζ/_{2} = (0, /δq, δp/); then
the sum of the areas of the incremental parallelograms is just

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i}{\Delta A_{i} = \omega(\zeta_{1},\zeta_{2}),}} & {(5.88)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /ω/ is the bilinear antisymmetric function introduced in equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.70][5.70]]). The function /ω/ is
invariant under canonical transformations, so the sum of the areas of
the incremental parallelograms is invariant under canonical
transformations.

There is an integral version of this differential relation. Consider the
oriented area of a region /R/′ in phase space (see
[[file:chapter005.html#Fig_5-2][figure 5.2]]). Suppose we make a
canonical transformation from coordinates <<p363>>(/q/′, /p/′) to (/q/,
/p/) taking region /R/′ to region /R/. The boundary of the region in the
transformed coordinates is just the image under the canonical
transformation of the original boundary. Let

$R_{q^{i},p_{i}}$

be the projection of the region /R/ onto the /q^{i}/, /p_{i}/ plane of
coordinate /q^{i}/ and conjugate momentum /p_{i}/, and let /A_{i}/ be
its area. Similarly, let

$R_{q\prime^{i},p_{i}^{\prime}}^{\prime}$

be the projection of /R/′ onto the

$q\prime^{i},p_{i}^{\prime}$

plane, and let

$A_{i}^{\prime}$

be its area.

#+caption: *Figure 5.2* A region /R/′ in phase space is mapped by a
canonical transformation /C/_{H} to a region /R/. The projections of
region /R/ onto the planes formed by canonical basis pairs /q_{j}/,
/p_{j}/ are /R_{j}/. The projections of /R/′ are ¶ $R_{j}^{\prime}$ ¶ .
In general, the areas of the regions /R/ and /R/′ are not the same, but
the sums of the areas of the canonical plane projections are the same.
[[file:images/Art_P988.jpg]]

The area of an arbitrary region is just the limit of the sum of the
areas of incremental parallelograms that cover the region, so the sum of
oriented areas is preserved by canonical transformations:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i}{A_{i} = {\sum\limits_{i}{A_{i}^{\prime}.}}}} & {(5.89)} \\
\end{array}$$

That is, the sum of the projected areas on the canonical planes is
preserved by canonical transformations. Another way to say this is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i}{\int_{R_{q^{i},p_{i}}}{dq^{i}dp_{i} = {\sum\limits_{i}{\int_{R_{q\prime^{i},p_{i}^{\prime}}^{\prime}}{dq\prime^{i}dp_{i}^{\prime}.}}}}}} & {(5.90)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p364>>

The equality-of-areas relation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.90][5.90]]) can also be written as an
equality of line integrals using Stokes's theorem, for simply-connected
regions

$R_{q^{i},p_{i}}$

and

$R_{q\prime^{i},p_{i}^{\prime}}^{\prime}$

:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i}{\oint_{\partial R_{q^{i},p_{i}}}{p_{i}dq^{i} = {\sum\limits_{i}{\oint_{\partial R_{q\prime^{i},p_{i}^{\prime}}^{\prime}}{p_{i}^{\prime}dq\prime^{i}.}}}}}} & {(5.91)} \\
\end{array}$$

The canonical planes are disjoint except at the origin, so the projected
areas intersect in at most one point. Thus we may independently
accumulate the line integrals around the boundaries of the individual
projections of the region onto the canonical planes into a line integral
around the unprojected region:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\oint_{\partial R}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}dq^{i} = {\oint_{\partial R\prime}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}^{\prime}dq\prime^{i}.}}}}}} & {(5.92)} \\
\end{array}$$

*Exercise 5.10: Watch out*

Consider the canonical transformation /C/_{H}:

$$(t,x,p) = C_{\text{H}}(t,\theta,J) = (t,\sqrt{2(J + a)}\,\sin\,\theta,\sqrt{2(J + a)}\,\cos\,\theta).$$

*a.* Show that the transformation is symplectic for any /a/.

*b.* Show that equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.92][5.92]]) is
not generally satisfied for the region enclosed by a curve of constant
/J/.

* *5.4 Generating Functions*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-31
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
We have considered a number of properties of general canonical
transformations without having a method for coming up with them. Here we
introduce the method of /generating functions/. The generating function
is a real-valued function that compactly specifies a canonical
transformation through its partial derivatives, as follows.

Consider a real-valued function /F/_{1}(/t/, /q/, /q/′) mapping
configurations expressed in two coordinate systems to the reals. We will
use /F/_{1} to construct a canonical transformation from one coordinate
system to the other. We will show that the following relations among the
coordinates, the momenta, and the Hamiltonians specify a canonical
transformation:

<<p365>>

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = \partial_{1}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.93)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime = - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.94)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - H(t,q,p) = \partial_{0}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime).} & {(5.95)} \\
\end{array}$$

The transformation will then be explicitly given by solving for one set
of variables in terms of the others: To obtain the primed variables in
terms of the unprimed ones, let /A/ be the inverse of ∂_{1}/F/_{1} with
respect to the third argument,

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = A(t,q,\partial_{1}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime));} & {(5.96)} \\
\end{array}$$

then

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = A(t,q,p)} & {(5.97)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime = - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,q,A(t,q,p)).} & {(5.98)} \\
\end{array}$$

Let /B/ be the coordinate part of the phase-space transformation /q/ =
/B/(/t/, /q/′, /p/′). This /B/ is an inverse function of ∂_{2}/F/_{1},
satisfying

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = B(t,q\prime, - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)).} & {(5.99)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using /B/, we have

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = B(t,q\prime,p\prime)} & {(5.100)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = \partial_{1}F_{1}(t,B(t,q\prime,p\prime),q\prime).} & {(5.101)} \\
\end{array}$$

To put the transformation in explicit form requires that the inverse
functions /A/ and /B/ exist.

We can use the above relations to verify that some given transformation
from one set of phase-space coordinates (/q/, /p/) with Hamiltonian
function /H/(/t/, /q/, /p/) to another set (/q/′, /p/′) with Hamiltonian
function /H/′(/t/, /q/′, /p/′) is canonical by finding an /F/_{1}(/t/,
/q/, /q/′) such that the above relations are satisfied. We can also use
arbitrarily chosen generating functions of type /F/_{1} to generate new
canonical transformations.

finding a suitable /F/_{1} generating function. The generating function
satisfies a set of partial differential equations,
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.93][5.93]]) and
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.94][5.94]]):

\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{I = - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,x,\theta).} & {(5.105)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using relations ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.102][5.102]]) and
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.103][5.103]]), which specify the
transformation, equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.104][5.104]])
can be rewritten

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p_{x} = x\alpha\cot\,\theta = \partial_{1}F_{1}(t,x,\theta),} & {(5.106)} \\
\end{array}$$

which is easily integrated to yield

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{1}(t,x,\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{2}x^{2}\,\cot\,\theta + \varphi(t,\theta),} & {(5.107)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /φ/ is some integration “constant” with respect to the first
integration. Substituting this form for /F/_{1} into the second partial
differential equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.105][5.105]]), we
find

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{I = - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,x,\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{2}\frac{x^{2}}{{(\sin\,\theta)}^{2}} - \partial_{1}\varphi(t,\theta),} & {(5.108)} \\
\end{array}$$

but if we set /φ/ = 0 the desired relations are recovered. So the
generating function

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{1}(t,x,\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{2}x^{2}\,\cot\,\theta} & {(5.109)} \\
\end{array}$$

generates the polar-canonical transformation. This shows that this
transformation is canonical.

We can prove directly that the transformation generated by an /F/_{1} is
canonical by showing that if Hamilton's equations are satisfied in one
set of coordinates then they will be satisfied in the other set of
coordinates. Let /F/_{1} take arguments (/t/, /x/, /y/). The relations
among the coordinates are

{p_{x} = \partial_{1}F_{1}(t,x,y)} & \\
{p_{y} = - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,x,y)} & {(5.110)} \\

<<p367>>

and the Hamiltonians are related by

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,y,p_{y}) = H(t,x,p_{x}) + \partial_{0}F_{1}(t,x,y).} & {(5.111)} \\
\end{array}$$

Substituting the generating function relations
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.110][5.110]]) into this equation, we have

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,y, - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,x,y))} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = H(t,x,\partial_{1}F_{1}(t,x,y)) + \partial_{0}F_{1}(t,x,y).} & {(5.112)} \\

Take the partial derivatives of this equality of expressions with
respect to the variables /x/ and /y/:^{[[#endnote_18][18]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{- {(\partial_{2}H\prime)}^{j}{(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{j})}_{i}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {(\partial_{1}H)}_{i} + {(\partial_{2}H)}^{j}{(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{1}F_{1})}_{j})}_{i} + {(\partial_{1}\partial_{0}F_{1})}_{i}} & \\

\end{array}$$

where the arguments are unambiguous and have been suppressed. On
solution paths we can use Hamilton's equations for the (/x/, /p_{x}/)
system to replace the partial derivatives of /H/ with derivatives of /x/
and /p_{x}/, obtaining

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{- {(\partial_{2}H\prime)}^{j}{(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{j})}_{i}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = - {(Dp_{x})}_{i} + {(Dx)}^{j}{(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{1}F_{1})}_{j})}_{i} + {(\partial_{1}\partial_{0}F_{1})}_{i}} & \\

\end{array}$$

Now compute the derivatives of /p_{x}/ and /p_{y}/, from equations
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.110][5.110]]), along consistent paths:

<<p368>>

$$\begin{matrix}
{{(Dp_{x})}_{i} = {(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{1}F_{1})}_{i})}_{j}{(Dx)}^{j} + {(\partial_{2}{(\partial_{1}F_{1})}_{i})}_{j}{(D_{y})}^{j} + \partial_{0}{(\partial_{1}F_{1})}_{i}} \\
{{(Dp_{y})}_{i} = - {(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{i})}_{j}{(Dx)}^{j} - {(\partial_{2}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{i})}_{j}{(D_{y})}^{j} - \partial_{0}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{i}.} \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(5.115)} \\

Using the fact that elementary partials commute,
(∂_{2}(∂_{1}/F/_{1})/_{i}/)/_{j}/ = (∂_{1}(∂_{2}/F/_{1})/_{j}/)/_{i}/,
and substituting this expression for (/Dp_{x}/)/_{i}/ into the first of
equations ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.114][5.114]]) yields

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{- {(\partial_{2}H\prime)}^{j}{(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{j})}_{i} = - {(\partial_{1}{(\partial_{2}F_{1})}_{j})}_{i}{(D_{y})}^{j}.} & {(5.116)} \\
\end{array}$$

Provided that ∂_{2}∂_{1}/F/_{1} is nonsingular,^{[[#endnote_19][19]]} we
have derived one of Hamilton's equations for the (/y/, /p_{y}/) system:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{D_{y}(t) = \partial_{2}H\prime(t,y(t),p_{y}(t)).} & {(5.117)} \\
\end{array}$$

Hamilton's other equation,

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{Dp_{y}(t) = - \partial_{1}H\prime(t,y(t),p_{y}(t)),} & {(5.118)} \\
\end{array}$$

can be derived in a similar way. So the generating function relations
indeed specify a canonical transformation.

The generating function representation of canonical transformations can

show that, given a canonical transformation, the integral invariants
imply the existence of a function of phase-space coordinates that can be
written as a path-independent line integral. Then we show that partial
derivatives of this function, represented in mixed coordinates, give the
generating function relations between the old and new coordinates. We
need to do this only for time-independent transformations because

where /R/′ is a two-dimensional region in (/q/′, /p/′) coordinates at
time /t/, /R/ = /C_{t}/(/R/′) is the corresponding region in (/q/, /p/)
coordinates, and ∂/R/ indicates the boundary of the region /R/. This
holds for any region and its boundary. We will show that this implies
there is a function /F/ (/t/, /q/′, /p/′) that can be defined in terms
of line integrals

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F(t,q\prime,p\prime) - F(t,q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\int_{\gamma = C_{t}(\gamma\prime)}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}dq^{i} - {\int_{\gamma\prime}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}^{\prime}dq\prime^{i},}}}}}}} & {(5.120)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /γ/′ is a curve in phase-space coordinates that begins at

$\gamma\prime(0) = (q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime})$

and ends at /γ/′(1) = (/q/′, /p/′), and /γ/ is its image under /C_{t}/.

Let

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{G{}_{t}(\gamma\prime) = {\int_{\gamma = C_{t}(\gamma\prime)}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}dq^{i} - {\int_{\gamma\prime}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}^{\prime}dq\prime^{i},}}}}}}} & {(5.121)} \\
\end{array}$$

and let

$\gamma_{1}^{\prime}$

and

$\gamma_{2}^{\prime}$

be two paths with the same endpoints. Then

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{G_{t}(\gamma_{2}^{\prime}) - G_{t}(\gamma_{1}^{\prime})} & {= {\oint_{\partial R}{\sum{p_{i}dq^{i} - {\oint_{\partial R\prime}{\sum{p_{i}^{\prime}dq\prime^{i}}}}}}}} & \\
 & {= 0.} & {(5.122)} \\
\end{array}$$

So the value of /G_{t}/(/γ/′) depends only on the endpoints of /γ/′.

Let

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{\overline{G}}_{t,q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}}(q\prime,p\prime) = G_{t}(\gamma\prime),} & {(5.123)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /γ/′ is any path from

$q_{0}^{\prime},\, p_{0}^{\prime}$

to /q/′, /p/′. Changing the initial point from

$q_{0}^{\prime}\, p_{0}^{\prime}$

to

$q_{1}^{\prime}\, p_{1}^{\prime}$

changes the value of /Ḡ/ by a constant:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{\overline{G}}_{t,q_{1}^{\prime},p_{1}^{\prime}}(q\prime,p\prime) - {\overline{G}}_{t,q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}}(q\prime,p\prime) = {\overline{G}}_{t,q_{1}^{\prime},p_{1}^{\prime}}(q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}).} & {(5.124)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p370>>

If we define /F/ so that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F(t,q\prime,p\prime) = {\overline{G}}_{t,q_{1}^{\prime},p_{1}^{\prime}}(q\prime,p\prime),} & {(5.125)} \\
\end{array}$$

then

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F(t,q\prime,p\prime) - F(t,q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}) = {\overline{G}}_{t,q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}}(q\prime,p\prime),} & {(5.126)} \\
\end{array}$$

demonstrating equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.120][5.120]]).

The phase-space point (/q/, /p/) in unprimed variables corresponds to
(/q/′, /p/′) in primed variables, at an arbitrary time /t/. Both /p/ and
/q/ are determined given /q/′ and /p/′. In general, given any two of
these four quantities, we can solve for the other two. If we can solve
for the momenta in terms of the positions we get a particular class of
generating functions.^{[[#endnote_20][20]]} We introduce the functions

$$\begin{array}{crl}
p & {= f_{p}(t,q,q\prime)} & \\
{p\prime} & {= f_{p\prime}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.127)} \\
\end{array}$$

that solve the transformation equations (/t/, /q/, /p/) = /C/(/t/, /q/′,
/p/′) for the momenta in terms of the coordinates at a specified time.
With these we introduce a function /F/_{1}(/t/, /q/, /q/′) such that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{1}(t,q,q\prime) = F(t,q,f_{p}(t,q,q\prime)).} & {(5.128)} \\
\end{array}$$

The function /F/_{1} has the same value as /F/ but has different
arguments. We will show that this /F/_{1} is in fact the generating
function for canonical transformations introduced in
[[file:chapter005.html#h1-31][section 5.4]]. Let's be explicit about the
definition of /F/_{1} in terms of a line integral:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{1}(t,q,q\prime) - F_{1}(t,q_{0},q_{0}^{\prime})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\int_{q_{0},q_{0}^{\prime}}^{q,q\prime}{(f_{p}(t,q,q\prime)dq - f_{p\prime}(t,q,q\prime)dq\prime).}}} & {(5.129)} \\
\end{array}$$

The two line integrals can be combined into this one because they are
both expressed as integrals along a curve in (/q/, /q/′).

<<p371>>

We can use the path independence of /F/_{1} to compute the partial
derivatives of /F/_{1} with respect to particular components and
consequently derive the generating function relations for the
momenta.^{[[#endnote_21][21]]} So we conclude that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{(\partial_{1}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime))}_{i} = f_{p_{i}}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.130)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{(\partial_{2}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime))}_{i} = - f_{p_{i}^{\prime}}(t,q,q\prime).} & {(5.131)} \\
\end{array}$$

These are just the configuration and momentum parts of the generating
function relations for canonical transformation. So starting with a
canonical transformation, we can find a generating function that gives
the coordinate--momentum part of the transformation through its
derivatives.

Starting from a general canonical transformation, we have constructed an
/F/_{1} generating function from which the canonical transformation may
be rederived. So we expect there is a generating function for every
canonical transformation.^{[[#endnote_22][22]]}

Point transformations were excluded from the previous argument because
we could not deduce the momenta from the coordinates. However, a similar
derivation allows us to make a generating function for this case. The
integral invariants give us an equality of area integrals. There are
other ways of writing the equality-of-areas relation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.90][5.90]]) as a line integral. We can
also write

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\oint_{\partial R}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}dq^{i} = - {\oint_{\partial R\prime}{\sum\limits_{i}{q_{i}^{\prime}dp\prime^{i}.}}}}}} & {(5.132)} \\

The minus sign arises because by flipping the axes we are traversing the
area in the opposite sense. Repeating the argument just <<p372>>given,
we can define a function

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - F\prime(t,q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\int_{\gamma = C(t,\gamma\prime)}{\sum\limits_{i}{p_{i}dq^{i} + {\int_{\gamma\prime}{\sum\limits_{i}{q_{i}^{\prime}dp\prime^{i}}}}}}}} & {(5.133)} \\
\end{array}$$

that is independent of the path /γ/′. If we can solve for /q/′ and /p/
in terms of /q/ and /p/′ we can define the functions

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = f_{q\prime}^{\prime}(t,q,p\prime)} & \\
{p = f_{p}^{\prime}(t,q,p\prime)} & {(5.134)} \\

and define

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) = F\prime(t,f_{q\prime}^{\prime}(t,q,p\prime),p\prime).} & {(5.135)} \\
\end{array}$$

Then the canonical transformation is given as partial derivatives of
/F/_{2}:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{(\partial_{1}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime))}_{i} = f_{p_{i}}^{\prime}(t,q,p\prime)} & {(5.136)} \\

For canonical transformations that can be described by both an /F/_{1}
and an /F/_{2}, there must be a relation between them. The alternative
line integral expressions for the area integral are related. Consider
the difference

\end{array}$$

The functions /F/ and /F/′ are related by an integrated term

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - F(t,q\prime,p\prime) = p\prime q\prime,} & {(5.139)} \\

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) - F_{1}(t,q,q\prime) = p\prime q\prime.} & {(5.140)} \\
\end{array}$$

The generating functions /F/_{1} and /F/_{2} are related by a Legendre
transform:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime = - \partial_{2}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.141)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime q\prime = - F_{1}(t,q,q\prime) + F_{2}(t,q,p\prime)} & {(5.142)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = \partial{}_{2}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime).} & {(5.143)} \\
\end{array}$$

We have passive variables /q/ and /t/:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{- \partial_{1}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime) + \partial_{1}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) = 0} & {(5.144)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{- \partial_{0}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime) + \partial_{0}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) = 0.} & {(5.145)} \\
\end{array}$$

But /p/ = ∂_{1}/F/_{1}(/t/, /q/, /q/′) from the first transformation, so

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = \partial_{1}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime).} & {(5.146)} \\
\end{array}$$

Furthermore, since /H/′(/t/, /q/′, /p/′) − /H/(/t/, /q/, /p/) =
∂_{0}/F/_{1}(/t/, /q/, /q/′) we can conclude that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - H(t,q,p) = \partial_{0}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime).} & {(5.147)} \\

*** *5.4.3 Types of Generating Functions*
    :PROPERTIES:

We have used generating functions of the form /F/_{1}(/t/, /q/, /q/′) to
construct canonical transformations:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = \partial_{1}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.148)} \\
\end{array}$$
$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime = - \partial{}_{2}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)} & {(5.149)} \\

{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - H(t,q,p) = \partial_{0}F_{1}(t,q,q\prime).} & {(5.150)} \\
\end{array}$$

We can also construct canonical transformations with generating
functions of the form /F/_{2}(/t/, /q/, /p/′), where the third argument
of /F/_{2} is the momentum in the primed system.^{[[#endnote_23][23]]}

<<p374>>

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = \partial_{1}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime)} & {(5.151)} \\

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = \partial_{2}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime)} & {(5.152)} \\

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - H(t,q,p) = \partial_{0}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime)} & {(5.153)} \\
\end{array}$$

As in the /F/_{1} case, to put the transformation in explicit form
requires that appropriate inverse functions be constructed to allow the
solution of the equations.

Similarly, we can construct two other forms for generating functions,
named mnemonically enough /F/_{3} and /F/_{4}:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = - \partial_{1}F_{3}(t,p,q\prime)} & {(5.154)} \\
\end{array}$$
$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime = - \partial_{2}F_{3}(t,p,q\prime)} & {(5.155)} \\

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) - H(t,q,p) = \partial_{0}F_{3}(t,p,q\prime)} & {(5.156)} \\
\end{array}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = - \partial_{1}F_{4}(t,p,p\prime)} & {(5.157)} \\
\end{array}$$
$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = \partial_{2}F_{4}(t,p,p\prime)} & {(5.158)} \\
\end{array}$$
$$\begin{matrix}
{H\prime\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right) - H\left( {t,q,p} \right) = \partial_{0}F_{4}\left( {t,p,p\prime} \right)} & \left( 5.159 \right) \\
\end{matrix}$$

These four classes of generating functions are called /mixed-variable
generating functions/ because the canonical transformations they
generate give a mixture of old and new variables in terms of a mixture
of old and new variables.

In every case, if the generating function does not depend explicitly on
time then the Hamiltonians are obtained from one another purely by
composition with the appropriate canonical transformation. If the
generating function depends on time, then there are additional terms.

The generating functions presented each treat the coordinates and
momenta collectively. One could define more complicated generating
functions for which the transformations of different degrees of freedom
are specified by generating functions of different types.

*** *5.4.4 Point Transformations*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_5-4-4
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
Point transformations can be represented in terms of a generating
function of type /F/_{2}. Equations
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.6][5.6]]), which define a canonical point
transformation derived from a coordinate transformation /F/, are

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(t,q,p) = C(t,q\prime,p\prime) = (t,F(t,q\prime),p\prime{(\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime))}^{- 1}).} & {(5.160)} \\
\end{array}$$

Let /S/ be the inverse transformation of /F/ with respect to the second
argument

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q\prime = S(t,q),} & {(5.161)} \\
\end{array}$$

so that /q/′ = /S/(/t/, /F/ (/t/, /q/′)). The momentum transformation
that accompanies this coordinate transformation is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p\prime = p{(\partial_{1}S(t,q))}^{- 1}.} & {(5.162)} \\
\end{array}$$

We can find the generating function /F/_{2} that gives this
transformation by integrating equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.152][5.152]]) to get

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) = p\prime S(t,q) + \varphi(t,q).} & {(5.163)} \\
\end{array}$$

Substituting this into equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.151][5.151]]), we get

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = p\prime\partial_{1}S(t,q) + \partial_{1}\varphi(t,q).} & {(5.164)} \\
\end{array}$$

We do not need the freedom provided by /φ/, so we can set it equal to
zero:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) = p\prime S(t,q),} & {(5.165)} \\
\end{array}$$

with

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = p\prime\partial_{1}S(t,q).} & {(5.166)} \\
\end{array}$$

So this /F/_{2} gives the canonical transformation of equations
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.161][5.161]]) and
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.162][5.162]]).

The canonical transformation for the coordinate transformation /S/ is
the inverse of the canonical transformation for /F/. By design /F/ and
/S/ are inverses on the coordinate arguments. The identity function is
/q/ = /I/(/q/′) = /S/(/t/, /F/ (/t/, /q/′)). Differentiating yields

<<p376>>

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{1 = \partial_{1}S(t,F(t,q\prime))\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime),} & {(5.167)} \\
\end{array}$$

so

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime) = {(\partial_{1}S(t,F(t,q\prime)))}^{- 1}.} & {(5.168)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using this, the relation between the momenta
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.166][5.166]]) is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = p\prime{(\partial_{1}F(t,q\prime))}^{- 1},} & {(5.169)} \\
\end{array}$$

showing that /F/_{2} gives a point transformation equivalent to the
point transformation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.160][5.160]]). So
from this other point of view the point transformation is canonical.

The /F/_{1} that corresponds to the /F/_{2} for a point transformation
is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{F_{1}(t,q,q\prime)} & {= F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) - p\prime q\prime} & \\
 & {= p\prime S(t,q) - p\prime q\prime} & \\
 & {= 0.} & {(5.170)} \\
\end{array}$$

This is why we could not use generating functions of type /F/_{1} to
construct point transformations.

** *Polar and rectangular coordinates*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: polar-and-rectangular-coordinates
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
A commonly required point transformation is the transition between polar
coordinates and rectangular coordinates:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x = r\,\cos\,\theta} & {(5.171)} \\
{y = r\,\sin\,\theta.} & \\
\end{array}$$

Using the formula for the generating function of a point transformation
just derived, we find:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t;r,\theta;p_{x},p_{y}) = \lbrack\begin{array}{ll}
p_{x} & {p_{y}\rbrack\left( \begin{array}{l}
{r\,\cos\,\theta} \\
{r\,\sin\,\theta} \\
\end{array} \right).} \\
\end{array}} & {(5.172)} \\
\end{array}$$

So the full transformation is derived:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{(x,y)} & {= \partial_{2}F_{2}(t;r,\theta;p_{x},p_{y})} & \\
 & {= (r\,\cos\,\theta,r\,\sin\,\theta)} & \\
{\lbrack p_{r},p_{\theta}\rbrack} & {= \partial_{1}F_{2}(t;r,\theta;p_{x},p_{y})} & \\
 & {= \lbrack p_{x}\,\cos\,\theta + p_{y}\,\sin\,\theta, - p_{x}r\,\sin\,\theta + p_{y}r\,\cos\,\theta\rbrack.} & {(5.173)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p377>>

We can isolate the rectangular coordinates to one side of the
transformation and the polar coordinates to the other:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p_{r} = \frac{1}{r}(p_{x}x + p_{y}y)} & \\
{p_{\theta} = - p_{x}y + p_{y}x.} & {(5.174)} \\
\end{array}$$

So, interpreted in terms of Newtonian vectors,

$p_{r} = \widehat{r} \cdot \overset{\rightarrow}{p}$

is the radial component of the linear momentum and

$p_{\theta} = \left\| {\overset{\rightarrow}{r} \times \overset{\rightarrow}{p}} \right\|$

is the magnitude of the angular momentum. The point transformation is
time independent, so the Hamiltonian transforms by composition.

** *Rotating coordinates*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: rotating-coordinates-1
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
A useful time-dependent point transformation is the transition to a
rotating coordinate system. This is most easily accomplished in polar
coordinates. Here we have

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{r\prime = r} & \\
{\theta\prime = \theta - \Omega t,} & {(5.175)} \\
\end{array}$$

where Ω is the angular velocity of the rotating coordinate system. The
generating function is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t;r,\theta;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime}) = \lbrack\begin{array}{ll}
p_{r}^{\prime} & {p_{\theta}^{\prime}\rbrack} \\
\end{array}\left( \begin{array}{l}
r \\
{\theta - \Omega t} \\
\end{array} \right).} & {(5.176)} \\
\end{array}$$

This yields the transformation equations

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{r\prime} & {= r} & \\
{\theta\prime} & {= \theta - \Omega t} & \\
p_{r} & {= p_{r}^{\prime}} & \\
p_{\theta} & {= p_{\theta}^{\prime},} & {(5.177)} \\
\end{array}$$

which show that the momenta are the same in both coordinate systems.
However, here the Hamiltonian is not a simple composition:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t;r\prime,\theta\prime;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime}) = H(t;r\prime,\theta\prime + \Omega t;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime}) - p_{\theta}^{\prime}\Omega.} & {(5.178)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Hamiltonians differ by the derivative of the generating function
with respect to the time argument. In transforming to rotating
<<p378>>coordinates, the values of the Hamiltonians differ by the
product of the angular momentum and the angular velocity of the
coordinate system. Notice that this addition to the Hamiltonian is the
same as was found earlier ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.45][5.45]]).

** *Reducing the two-body problem to the one-body problem*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: reducing-the-two-body-problem-to-the-one-body-problem
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
In this example we illustrate how canonical transformations can be used
to eliminate some of the degrees of freedom, leaving a problem with
fewer degrees of freedom.

Suppose that only certain combinations of the coordinates appear in the
Hamiltonian. We make a canonical transformation to a new set of
phase-space coordinates such that these combinations of the old
phase-space coordinates are some of the new phase-space coordinates. We
choose other independent combinations of the coordinates to complete the
set. The advantage is that these other independent coordinates do not
appear in the new Hamiltonian, so the momenta conjugate to them are
conserved quantities.

Let's see how this idea enables us to reduce the problem of two
gravitating bodies to the simpler problem of the relative motion of the
two bodies. In the process we will discover that the momentum of the
center of mass is conserved. This simpler problem is an instance of the
Kepler problem. The Kepler problem is also encountered in the
formulation of the more general /n/-body problem.

Consider the motion of two masses /m/_{1} and /m/_{2}, subject only to a
mutual gravitational attraction described by the potential /V/ (/r/).
This problem has six degrees of freedom. The rectangular coordinates of
the particles are /x/_{1} and /x/_{2}, with conjugate momenta /p/_{1}
and /p/_{2}. Each of these is a structure of the three rectangular
components. The distance between the particles is /r/ = ‖/x/_{1} −
/x/_{2}‖. The Hamiltonian for the two-body problem is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t;x_{1},x_{2};p_{1},p_{2}) = \frac{p_{1}^{2}}{2m_{1}} + \frac{p_{2}^{2}}{2m_{2}} + V(r).} & {(5.179)} \\
\end{array}$$

The gravitational potential energy depends only on the relative
positions of the two bodies. We do not need to specify /V/ further at
this point.

<<p379>>

Since the only combination of coordinates that appears in the
Hamiltonian is /x/_{2} − /x/_{1}, we choose new coordinates so that one
of the new coordinates is this combination:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x = x_{2} - x_{1}.} & {(5.180)} \\
\end{array}$$

To complete the set of new coordinates we choose another to be some
independent linear combination

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{X = ax_{1} + bx_{2},} & {(5.181)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /a/ and /b/ are to be determined. We can use an /F/_{2}-type
generating function

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}(t;x_{1},x_{2};p,P) = (x_{2} - x_{1})p + (ax_{1} + bx_{2})P,} & {(5.182)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /p/ and /P/ will be the new momenta conjugate to /x/ and /X/,
respectively. We deduce

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\,\,(x,X) = \partial_{2}F_{2}(t;x_{1},x_{2};p,P) = (x_{2} - x_{1},ax_{1} + bx_{2})} & \\
{\left\lbrack {p_{1},p{}_{2}} \right\rbrack = \partial_{1}F_{2}(t;x_{1},x_{2};p,P) = \left\lbrack {- p + aP,p + bP} \right\rbrack.} & {(5.183)} \\
\end{array}$$

We can solve these for the new momenta:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{P = \frac{p_{1} + p_{2}}{a + b}} & {(5.184)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = \frac{ap_{2} - bp_{1}}{a + b}.} & {(5.185)} \\
\end{array}$$

The generating function is not time dependent, so the new Hamiltonian is
the old Hamiltonian composed with the transformation:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H\prime(t;x,X;p,P)} & {= \frac{{( - p + aP)}^{2}}{2m_{1}} + \frac{{(p + bP)}^{2}}{2m_{2}} + V(\left\| x \right\|)} & \\
 & {= \frac{p^{2}}{2m} + \frac{P^{2}}{2M} + V(\left\| x \right\|)} & \\
 & {\,\,\,\,\, + \left( {\frac{b}{m_{2}} - \frac{a}{m_{1}}} \right)pP,} & {(5.186)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p380>>

with the definitions

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{1}{m} = \frac{1}{m_{1}} + \frac{1}{m_{2}}} & {(5.187)} \\
\end{array}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{1}{M} = \frac{a^{2}}{m_{1}} + \frac{b^{2}}{m_{2}}.} & {(5.188)} \\
\end{array}$$

We recognize /m/ as the “reduced mass.”

Notice that if the term proportional to /pP/ were not present then the
/x/ and /X/ degrees of freedom would not be coupled at all, and
furthermore, the /X/ part of the Hamiltonian would be just the
Hamiltonian of a free particle, which is easy to solve. The condition
that the “cross terms” disappear is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{b}{m_{2}} - \frac{a}{m_{1}} = 0,} & {(5.189)} \\
\end{array}$$

which is satisfied by

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{a = cm_{1}} & \\
{b = cm_{2}} & {(5.190)} \\
\end{array}$$

for any /c/. For a transformation to be defined, /c/ must be nonzero. So
with this choice the Hamiltonian becomes

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t;x,X;p,P) = H_{X}(t,X,P) + H_{x}(t,x,p)} & {(5.191)} \\
\end{array}$$

with

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H_{x}(t,x,p) = \frac{p^{2}}{2m} + V(r)} & {(5.192)} \\
\end{array}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H_{X}(t,X,P) = \frac{P^{2}}{2M}.} & {(5.193)} \\
\end{array}$$

The reduced mass is the same as before, and now

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{M = \frac{1}{c^{2}(m_{1} + m_{2})}.} & {(5.194)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p381>>

Notice that, without further specifying /c/, the problem has been
separated into the problem of determining the relative motion of the two
masses, and the problem of the other degrees of freedom. We did not need
a priori knowledge that the center of mass might be important; in fact,
only for a particular choice of /c/ = (/m/_{1} + /m/_{2})^{−1} does /X/
become the center of mass.

** *Epicyclic motion*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: epicyclic-motion
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
It is often useful to compose a sequence of canonical transformations to
make up the transformation we need for any particular mechanical
problem. The transformations we have supplied are especially useful as
components in these computations.

We will illustrate the use of canonical transformations to learn about
planar motion in a central field. The strategy will be to consider
perturbations of circular motion in the central field. The analysis will
proceed by transforming to a rotating coordinate system that rides on a
circular reference orbit, and then making approximations that restrict
the analysis to orbits that differ from the circular orbit only
slightly.

In rectangular coordinates we can easily write a Hamiltonian for the
motion of a particle of mass /m/ in a field defined by a potential
energy that is a function only of the distance from the origin as
follows:

$$\begin{matrix}
{H(t;\, x,\, y;p_{x},p_{y}) = \frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2}}{2m} + V(\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}).} & {(5.195)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

In this coordinate system Hamilton's equations are easy, and they are
exactly what is needed to develop trajectories by numerical integration,
but the expressions are not very illuminating:

$$Dx\begin{matrix}
{= \frac{p_{x}}{m}} & {(5.196)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$Dy\begin{matrix}
{= \frac{p_{y}}{m}} & {(5.197)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$Dp_{x}\begin{matrix}
{= - DV(\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}})\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}}} & {(5.198)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$Dp_{y}\begin{matrix}
{= - DV(\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}})\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}}.} & {(5.199)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p382>>

We can learn more by converting to polar coordinates centered on the
source of our field:

$$\begin{matrix}
{x = r\cos\varphi} & {(5.200)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{y = r\sin\varphi.} & {(5.201)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

This coordinate system explicitly incorporates the geometrical symmetry
of the potential energy. Extending this coordinate transformation to a
point transformation, we can write the new Hamiltonian as:

$$\begin{matrix}
{H\prime(t;\, r,\,\varphi;\, p_{r},\, p_{\varphi}) = \frac{p_{r}^{2}}{2m} + \frac{p_{\varphi}^{2}}{2mr^{2}} + V(r).} & {(5.202)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

We can now write Hamilton's equations in these new coordinates, and they
are much more illuminating than the equations expressed in rectangular
coordinates:

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dr = \frac{p_{r}}{m}} & {(5.203)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\varphi = \frac{p_{\varphi}}{mr^{2}}} & {(5.204)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dp_{r} = \frac{p_{\varphi}^{2}}{mr^{3}} - DV(r)} & {(5.205)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dp_{\varphi} = 0.} & {(5.206)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

The angular momentum /p_{φ}/ is conserved, and we are free to choose its
constant value, so /Dφ/ depends only on /r/. We also see that we can
establish a circular orbit at any radius /R/_{0}: we choose /p_{φ}/ =
/p/_{/φ/0} so that

$p_{\varphi 0}^{2}/(mR_{0}^{3}) - DV(R_{0}) = 0$

. This will ensure that /Dp_{r}/ = 0, and thus /Dr/ = 0. The square of
the angular velocity of this circular orbit is

$$\Omega^{2}\begin{matrix}
{= \frac{DV(R_{0})}{mR_{0}}.} & {(5.207)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

It is instructive to consider how orbits that are close to the circular
orbit differ from the circular orbit. This is best done in rotating
coordinates in which a body moving in the circular orbit is a stationary
point at the origin. We can do this by converting to coordinates that
are rotating with the circular orbit and centered on the orbiting body.
We proceed in three stages. First we will <<p383>>transform to a polar
coordinate system that is rotating at angular velocity Ω. Then we will
return to rectangular coordinates, and finally, we will shift the
coordinates so that the origin is on the reference circular orbit.

We start by examining the system in rotating polar coordinates. This is
a time-dependent coordinate transformation:

$$r\prime\begin{matrix}
{= r} & {(5.208)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\varphi\prime\begin{matrix}
{= \varphi - \Omega t} & {(5.209)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$p_{r}^{\prime}\begin{matrix}
{= pr} & {(5.210)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$p_{\varphi}^{\prime}\begin{matrix}
{= p_{\varphi}.} & {(5.211)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Using equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.178][5.178]]), we can
write the new Hamiltonian directly:

$$H''(t;r\prime,\,\varphi\prime;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\varphi}^{\prime})\begin{matrix}
{= \frac{p_{r}^{\prime 2}}{2m} + \frac{p_{\varphi}^{\prime 2}}{2mr\prime^{2}} + V(r\prime) - p_{\varphi}^{\prime}\Omega.} & {(5.212)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

/H/″ is not time dependent, and therefore it is conserved. It is not the
sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. Energy is not
conserved in the moving coordinate system, but what is conserved here is
a new quantity, the /Jacobi constant/, that combines the energy with the
product of the angular momentum of the particle in the new coordinate
and the angular velocity of the coordinate system. We will want to keep
track of this term.

Next, we return to rectangular coordinates, but they are rotating with
the reference circular orbit:

$$\begin{matrix}
{x\prime = r\prime\cos\varphi\prime} & {(5.213)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{y\prime = r\prime\sin\varphi\prime} & {(5.214)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{p_{x}^{\prime} = p_{r}^{\prime}\cos\varphi\prime - \frac{p_{\varphi}^{\prime}}{r\prime}\sin\varphi\prime} & {(5.215)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{p_{y}^{\prime} = p_{r}^{\prime}\sin\varphi\prime + \frac{p_{\varphi}^{\prime}}{r\prime}\cos\varphi\prime.} & {(5.216)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

The Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H'''(t;\, x\prime,\, y\prime;\, p_{x}^{\prime},\, p_{y}^{\prime})} & \\
{\,\,\, = \frac{p_{x}^{\prime 2} + p_{y}^{\prime 2}}{2m} + \Omega(y\prime p_{x}^{\prime} - x\prime p_{y}^{\prime}) + V(\sqrt{x\prime^{2} + y\prime^{2}}).} & {(5.217)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p384>>

With one more quick manipulation we shift the coordinate system so that
the origin is out on our circular orbit. We define new rectangular
coordinates /ξ/ and /η/ with the following simple canonical
transformation of coordinates and momenta:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\xi = x\prime - R_{0}} & {(5.218)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{\eta = y\prime} & {(5.219)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{p_{\xi} = p_{x}^{\prime}} & {(5.220)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{p_{\eta} = p_{y}^{\prime}.} & {(5.221)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

In this final coordinate system the Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H\operatorname{''''}(t;\,\xi,\,\eta;p_{\xi},p_{\eta}) =} & {\frac{p_{\xi}^{2} + p_{\eta}^{2}}{2m} + \Omega(\eta p_{\xi} - (\xi + R_{0})p_{\eta})} & \\
 & {+ V(\sqrt{{(\xi + R_{0})}^{2} + \eta^{2}}),} & {(5.222)} \\
\end{array}$$

and Hamilton's equations are uselessly complicated, but the next step is
to consider only trajectories for which the coordinates /ξ/ and /η/ are
small compared with /R/_{0}. Under this assumption we will be able to
construct approximate equations of motion for these trajectories that
are linear in the coordinates, thus yielding simple analyzable motion.
To this point we have made no approximations. The equations above are
perfectly accurate for any trajectories in a central field.

The idea is to expand the potential-energy term in the Hamiltonian as a
series and to discard any term higher than second-order in the
coordinates, thus giving us first-order-accurate Hamilton's equations:

$$\begin{matrix}
{U(\xi,\eta) = V(\sqrt{{(\xi + R_{0})}^{2} + \eta^{2}})} & {(5.223)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{= V(R_{0} + \xi + \frac{\eta^{2}}{2R_{0}} + ...)} & {(5.224)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{= V(R_{0}) + DV(R_{0})(\xi + \frac{\eta^{2}}{2R_{0}})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\, + D^{2}V(R_{0})\frac{\xi^{2}}{2} + \cdots.} & {(5.225)} \\
\end{array}$$

So the (negated) generalized forces are

$$\partial_{0}U(\xi,\eta)\begin{matrix}
{= DV(R_{0}) + D^{2}V(R_{0})\xi + \cdots} & {(5.226)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\partial_{1}U(\xi,\eta)\begin{matrix}
{= DV(R_{0})\frac{\eta}{R_{0}} + \cdots.} & {(5.227)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p385>>

With this expansion we obtain the linearized Hamilton's equations:

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\xi = \frac{p_{\xi}}{m} + \Omega\eta} & {(5.228)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{D\eta = \frac{p_{\eta}}{m} - \Omega(\xi + R_{0})} & {(5.229)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dp_{\xi} = - DV(R_{0}) - D^{2}V(R_{0})\xi + \cdots + \Omega p_{\eta}} & {(5.230)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{Dp_{\eta} = - DV(R_{0})\frac{\eta}{R_{0}} + ... - \Omega p_{\xi}.} & {(5.231)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Of course, once we have linear equations we know how to solve them
exactly. Because the linearized Hamiltonian is conserved we cannot get
exponential expansion or collapse, so the possible solutions are quite
limited. It is instructive to convert these equations into a
second-order system. We use Ω^{2} = /DV/(/R/_{0})/(/mR/_{0}), equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.207][5.207]]), to eliminate the /DV/
terms:

$$\begin{matrix}
{D^{2}\xi - 2\Omega D\eta = (\Omega^{2} - \frac{D^{2}V(R_{0})}{m})\xi} & {(5.232)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{D^{2}\eta + 2\Omega D\xi = 0.} & {(5.233)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Combining these, we find

$$\begin{matrix}
{D^{3}\xi + \omega^{2}D\xi = 0,} & {(5.234)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$$\begin{matrix}
{\omega^{2} = 3\Omega^{2} + \frac{D^{2}V(R_{0})}{m}.} & {(5.235)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Thus we have a simple harmonic oscillator with frequency /ω/ as one of
the components of the solution. The general solution has three parts:

$$\begin{matrix}
{\begin{pmatrix}
{\xi(t)} \\
{\eta(t)} \\
\end{pmatrix} = \eta_{0}\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
1 \\
\end{pmatrix}} & {(5.236)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{+ \xi_{0}\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
{- 2At} \\
\end{pmatrix}} & {(5.237)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{+ C_{0}\begin{pmatrix}
{\sin(\omega t + \varphi_{0})} \\
{\frac{2\Omega}{\omega}\cos(\omega t + \varphi_{0})} \\
\end{pmatrix}} & {(5.238)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

where

$$\begin{matrix}
{A = \frac{\Omega^{2}m - D^{2}V(R_{0})}{4\Omega m}.} & {(5.239)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p386>>

The constants /η/_{0}, /ξ/_{0}, /C/_{0}, and /φ/_{0} are determined by
the initial conditions. If /C/_{0} = 0, the particle of interest is on a
circular trajectory, but not necessarily the same one as the reference
trajectory. If /C/_{0} = 0 and /ξ/_{0} = 0, we have a “fellow traveler,”
a particle in the same circular orbit as the reference orbit but with
different phase. If /C/_{0} = 0 and /η/_{0} = 0, we have a particle in a
circular orbit that is interior or exterior to the reference orbit and
shearing away from the reference orbit. The shearing is due to the fact
that the angular velocity for a circular orbit varies with the radius.
The constant /A/ gives the rate of shearing at each radius. If both
/η/_{0} = 0 and /ξ/_{0} = 0 but /C/_{0} ≠ 0, then we have “epicyclic
motion.” A particle in a nearly circular orbit may be seen to move in an
ellipse around the circular reference orbit. The ellipse will be
elongated in the direction of circular motion by the factor 2Ω//ω/, and
it will rotate in the direction opposite to the direction of the
circular motion. The initial phase of the epicycle is /φ/_{0}. Of
course, any combination of these solutions may exist.

The epicyclic frequency /ω/ and the shearing rate /A/ are determined by
the force law (the radial derivative of the potential energy). For a
force law proportional to a power of the radius,

$$\begin{matrix}
{F \propto r^{1 - n},} & {(5.240)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

the epicyclic frequency is related to the orbital frequency by

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{\omega}{\Omega} = 2\sqrt{1 - \frac{n}{4}}} & {(5.241)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

and the shearing rate is

$$\begin{matrix}
{\frac{A}{\Omega} = \frac{n}{4}.} & {(5.242)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

For a few particular integer force laws we see:

[[file:images/Art_P1145.jpg]]

We can get some insight into the kinds of orbits produced by the
epicyclic approximation by looking at a few examples. For <<p387>>some
force laws we have integer ratios of epicyclic frequency to orbital
frequency. In those cases we have closed orbits. For an inverse-square
force law (/n/ = 3) we get elliptical orbits with the center of the
field at a focus of the ellipse. [[#Fig_5-3][Figure 5.3]] shows how an
approximation to such an orbit can be constructed by superposition of
the motion on an elliptical epicycle with the motion of the same
frequency on a circle. If the force is proportional to the radius (/n/ =
0) we get a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. Here the epicyclic
frequency is twice the orbital frequency. [[#Fig_5-4][Figure 5.4]] shows
how this yields elliptical orbits that are centered on the source of the
central force. An orbit is closed when /ω//Ω is a rational fraction. If
the force is proportional to the −3/4 power of the radius, the epicyclic
frequency is 3/2 the orbital frequency. This yields the three-lobed
pattern seen in [[file:chapter005.html#Fig_5-5][figure 5.5]]. For other
force laws the orbits predicted by this analysis are multi-lobed
patterns produced by precessing approximate ellipses. Most of the cases
have incommensurate epicyclic and orbital frequencies, leading to orbits
that do not close in finite time.

#+caption: *Figure 5.6* The numerically integrated orbit of a particle
with a force law /F/ ∝ /r/^{−2.3}. For this law the ratio of the
epicyclic frequency to the orbital frequency is about .83666---close to
5/6, but not quite. This is manifest in the nearly five-fold symmetry of
the rosette-like shape and the fact that one must cross approximately
six orbits to get from the inside to the outside of the rosette.
[[file:images/Art_P1149.jpg]]

The epicyclic approximation gives a very good idea of what actual orbits
look like. [[#Fig_5-6][Figure 5.6]], drawn by numerical integration of
the orbit produced by integrating the original rectangular equations of
motion for a particle in the field, shows the rosette-type picture
characteristic of incommensurate epicyclic and orbital frequencies for
an /F/ = −/r/^{−2.3} force law.

We can directly compare a numerically integrated system with one of our
epicyclic approximations. For example, the result of numerically
integrating our /F/ ∝ /r/^{−3/4} system is very similar to the picture
we obtained by epicycles. (See [[file:chapter005.html#Fig_5-7][figure
5.7]] and compare it with [[file:chapter005.html#Fig_5-5][figure 5.5]].)

*Exercise 5.11: Collapsing orbits*

What exactly happens as the force law becomes steeper? Investigate this
by sketching the contours of the Hamiltonian in /r/, /p_{r}/ space for
various values of the force-law exponent, /n/. For what values of /n/
are there stable circular orbits? In the case that there are no stable
circular orbits, what happens to circular and other noncircular orbits?
How are these results consistent with Liouville's theorem and the
nonexistence of attractors in Hamiltonian systems?

fact that one must cross two orbits to get from the inside to the

*** *5.4.5 Total Time Derivatives*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_5-4-5
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
The addition of a total time derivative to a Lagrangian leads to the
same Lagrange equations. However, the two Lagrangians have different
momenta, and they lead to different Hamilton's equations. Here we find
out how to represent the corresponding canonical transformation with a
generating function.

Let's restate the result about total time derivatives and Lagrangians
from the first chapter. Consider some function /G/(/t/, /q/) of time and
coordinates. We have shown that if /L/ and /L/′ are related by

$$\begin{matrix}
{L\prime(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) = L(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) + \partial_{0}G(t,q) + \partial_{1}G(t,q)\overset{˙}{q}} & {(5.243)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

then the Lagrange equations of motion are the same. The generalized
coordinates used in the two Lagrangians are the same, but the momenta
conjugate to the coordinates are different. In the usual way, define

$$\mathcal{P}\begin{matrix}
{(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) = \partial_{2}L(t,q,\overset{˙}{q})} & {(5.244)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

<<p391>>

and

$$\mathcal{P}\prime\begin{matrix}
{(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) = \partial_{2}L\prime(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}).} & {(5.245)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

So we have

$$\mathcal{P}\prime\begin{matrix}
{(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) = \mathcal{P}(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) + \partial_{1}G(t,q).} & {(5.246)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

Evaluated on a trajectory, we have

$$p\prime\begin{matrix}
{(t) = p(t) + \partial_{1}G(t,q(t)).} & {(5.247)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

This transformation is a special case of an /F/_{2}-type transformation.
Let

$$F_{2}\begin{matrix}
{(t,q,p\prime) = qp\prime - G(t,q);} & {(5.248)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

then the associated transformation is

$$\begin{matrix}
{q\prime = \partial_{2}F_{2}(t,\, q,\,\, p\prime) = q} & {(5.249)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{matrix}
{p = \partial_{1}F_{2}(t,q,p\prime) = p\prime - \partial_{1}G(t,q)} & {(5.250)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H\prime\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right)} & {= H\left( {t,q,p} \right) + \partial_{0}F_{2}\left( {t,q,p\prime} \right)} & \\
 & {= H\left( {t,q,p} \right) - \partial_{0}G\left( {t,q} \right).} & \left( 5.251 \right) \\
\end{array}$$

Explicitly, the new Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{matrix}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) = H(t,q\prime,p\prime - \partial_{1}G(t,q\prime)) - \partial_{0}G(t,q\prime),} & {(5.252)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

where we have used the fact that /q/ = /q/′. The transformation is
interesting in that the coordinate transformation is the identity
transformation, but the new and old momenta are not the same, even in
the case in which /G/ has no explicit time dependence. Suppose we have a
Hamiltonian of the form

$$\begin{matrix}
{H(t,x,p) = \frac{p^{2}}{2m} + V(x);} & {(5.253)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

then the transformed Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{matrix}
{H\prime(t,x\prime,p\prime) = \frac{{(p\prime - \partial_{1}G(t,x\prime))}^{2}}{2m} + V(x\prime) - \partial_{0}G(t,x\prime).} & {(5.254)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

We see that this transformation may be used to modify terms in the
Hamiltonian that are linear in the momenta. Starting from /H/,
<<p392>>the transformation introduces linear momentum terms; starting
from /H/′, the transformation eliminates the linear terms.

** *Driven pendulum*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: driven-pendulum
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
We illustrate the use of this transformation with the driven pendulum.
The Hamiltonian for the driven pendulum derived from the /T/ − /V/
Lagrangian (see [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]) is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t,\theta,p_{\theta})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{2ml^{2}} - glm\cos\theta} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, + gmy_{s}(t) - \frac{p_{\theta}}{l}\sin\theta Dy_{s}(t) - \frac{m}{2}{(\cos\theta)}^{2}{(Dy_{s}(t))}^{2},} & {(5.255)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /y_{s}/ is the drive function. The Hamiltonian is rather messy,
and includes a term that is linear in the angular momentum with a
coefficient that depends on both the angular coordinate and the time.
Let's see what happens if we apply our transformation to the problem to
eliminate the linear term. We can identify the transformation function
/G/ by requiring that the linear term in momentum be killed:

$$\begin{matrix}
{G(t,\theta) = - ml\cos\theta Dy_{s}(t).} & {(5.256)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

The transformed momentum is

$$p_{\theta}^{\prime} = p_{\theta}\begin{matrix}
{+ ml\sin\theta Dy_{s}(t),} & {(5.257)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

and the transformed Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H\prime(t,\theta,p_{\theta}^{\prime}) =} & {\frac{{(p_{\theta}^{\prime})}^{2}}{2ml^{2}} - ml(g + D^{2}y_{s})\cos\theta} & \\
 & {+ gmy_{s}(t) - \frac{m}{2}{(y_{s}(t))}^{2}.} & {(5.258)} \\
\end{array}$$

Dropping the last two terms, which do not affect the equations of
motion, we find

$$\begin{matrix}
{H\prime(t,\theta,p_{\theta}^{\prime}) = \frac{{(p_{\theta}^{\prime})}^{2}}{2ml^{2}} - ml(g + D^{2}y_{s})\cos\theta.} & {(5.259)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

So we have found, by a straightforward canonical transformation, a
Hamiltonian for the driven pendulum with the rather simple form of a
pendulum with gravitational acceleration that is modified <<p393>>by the
acceleration of the pivot. It is, in fact, the Hamiltonian that
corresponds to the alternative form of the Lagrangian for the driven
pendulum that we found earlier by inspection (see equation
[[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.120][1.120]]). Here the derivation is by a
simple canonical transformation, motivated by a desire to eliminate
unwanted terms that are linear in the momentum.

*Exercise 5.12: Construction of generating functions*

Suppose that canonical transformations

$\left( {t,q,p} \right) = C_{a}\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right)\,\text{and}\,\left( {t,q\prime,p\prime} \right) = C_{b}\left( {t,q'',p''} \right)$

are generated by two /F/_{1}-type generating functions, /F/_{1/a/}(/t/,
/q/, /q/′) and /F/_{1/b/}(/t/, /q/′, /q/″).

*a.* Show that the generating function for the inverse transformation of
/C_{a}/ is /F/_{1/c/}(/t/, /q/′, /q/) = −/F/_{1/a/}(/t/, /q/, /q/′).

*b.* Define a new kind of generating function,

/F_{x}/(/t/, /q/, /q/′, /q/″) = /F/_{1/a/}(/t/, /q/, /q/′) +
/F/_{1/b/}(/t/, /q/′, /q/″).

We see that

/p/ = ∂_{1}/F/_{/x/}(/t/, /q/, /q/′, /q/″) = ∂_{1}/F/_{1/a/}(/t/, /q/,
/q/′)

/p/″ = −∂_{3}/F_{x}/(/t/, /q/, /q/′, /q/″) = −∂_{2}/F/_{1/b/}(/t/, /q/′,
/q/″)

Show that ∂_{2}/F/_{/x/} = 0, allowing a solution to eliminate /q/′.

*c.* Using the formulas for /p/ and /p/″ above, and the result from part
*b*, Show that /F_{x}/ is an appropriate generating function for the
composition transformation /C/_{/a/} ∘ /C/_{/b/}.

*Exercise 5.13: Linear canonical transformations*

We consider systems with two degrees of freedom and transformations for
which the Hamiltonian transforms by composition.

*a.* Consider the linear canonical transformations that are generated by

$F_{2}(t;x_{1},x_{2};p_{1}^{\prime},p_{2}^{\prime}) = p_{1}^{\prime}ax_{1} + p_{1}^{\prime}bx_{2} + p_{2}^{\prime}cx_{1} + p_{2}^{\prime}dx_{2}.$

Show that these transformations are just the point transformations, and
that the corresponding /F/_{1} is zero.

*b.* Other linear canonical transformations can be generated by

$F_{1}(t;x_{1},x_{2};x_{1}^{\prime},x_{2}^{\prime}) = x_{1}^{\prime}ax_{1} + x_{1}^{\prime}bx_{2} + x_{2}^{\prime}cx_{1} + x_{2}^{\prime}dx_{2}.$

Surely we can make even more generators by constructing /F/_{3}- and
/F/_{4}-type transformations analogously. Are all of the linear
canonical transformations <<p394>>obtainable in this way? If not, show
one that cannot be so generated.

*c.* Can all linear canonical transformations be generated by
compositions of transformations generated by the functions shown in
parts *a* and *b* above?

*d.* How many independent parameters are necessary to specify all
possible linear canonical transformations for systems with two degrees
of freedom?

*Exercise 5.14: Integral invariants*

Consider the linear canonical transformation for a system with two
degrees of freedom generated by the function

$F_{1}(t;x_{1},x_{2};x_{1}^{\prime},x_{2}^{\prime}) = x_{1}^{\prime}ax_{1} + x_{1}^{\prime}bx_{2} + x_{2}^{\prime}cx_{1} + x_{2}^{\prime}dx_{2},$

and the general parallelogram with a vertex at the origin and with
adjacent sides starting at the origin and extending to the phase-space
points (/x/_{1/a/}, /x/_{2/a/}, /p/_{1/a/}, /p/_{2/a/}) and (/x/_{1/b/},
/x/_{2/b/}, /p/_{1/b/}, /p/_{2/b/}).

*a.* Find the area of the given parallelogram and the area of the target
parallelogram under the canonical transformation. Notice that the area
of the parallelogram is not preserved.

*b.* Find the areas of the projections of the given parallelogram and
the areas of the projections of the target under canonical
transformation. Show that the sum of the areas of the projections on the
action-like planes is preserved.

*Exercise 5.15: Standard-map generating function*

Find a generating function for the standard map (see

[[file:chapter005.html#p357][page 357]]).

* *5.5 Extended Phase Space*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-32
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
In this section we show that we can treat time as just another
coordinate if we wish. Systems described by a time-dependent Hamiltonian
may be recast in terms of a time-independent Hamiltonian with an extra
degree of freedom. An advantage of this view is that what was a
time-dependent canonical transformation can be treated as a
time-independent transformation, where there are no additional
conditions for adjusting the Hamiltonian.

Suppose that we have some system characterized by a time-dependent
Hamiltonian, for example, a periodically driven pendulum. <<p395>>We may
imagine that there is some extremely massive oscillator, unperturbed by
the motion of the relatively massless pendulum, that produces the drive.
Indeed, we may think of time itself as the coordinate of an infinitely
massive particle moving uniformly and driving everything else. We often
consider the rotation of the Earth as exactly such a stable time
reference when performing short-time experiments in the laboratory.

More formally, consider a dynamical system with /n/ degrees of freedom,
whose behavior is described by a possibly time-dependent Lagrangian /L/
with corresponding Hamiltonian /H/. We make a new dynamical system with
/n/ + 1 degrees of freedom by extending the generalized coordinates to
include time and introducing a new independent variable. We also extend
the generalized velocities to include a velocity for the time
coordinate. In this new /extended state space/ the coordinates are
redundant, so there is a constraint relating the time coordinate to the
new independent variable.

We relate the original dynamical system to the extended dynamical system
as follows: Let /q/ be a coordinate path. Let (/q_{e}/, /t/) : /τ/ ↦
(/q_{e}/(/τ/), /t/(/τ/)) be a coordinate path in the extended system
where /τ/ is the new independent variable. Then /q_{e}/ = /q/ ∘ /t/, or
/q_{e}/(/τ/) = /q/(/t/(/τ/)). Consequently, if /v/ = /Dq/ is the
velocity along a path then /v_{e}/(/τ/) = /Dq_{e}/(/τ/) = /Dq/(/t/(/τ/))
· /Dt/(/τ/) = /v/(/t/(/τ/)) · /v_{t}/(/τ/).

We can find a Lagrangian for the extended system by requiring that the
value of the action be unchanged. Introduce the extended Lagrangian
action

$$\begin{matrix}
{S_{e}\lbrack q_{e},t\rbrack(\tau_{1},\tau_{2}) = {\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}{(L_{e} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q_{e},t\rbrack),}}} & {(5.260)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

with

$$\begin{matrix}
{L_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;v_{e},v_{t}) = L(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t})v_{t}.} & {(5.261)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

We have

$$\begin{matrix}
{S\lbrack q\rbrack(t(\tau_{1}),t(\tau_{2})) = S_{e}\lbrack q \circ t,t\rbrack(\tau_{1},\tau_{2}).} & {(5.262)} \\
\end{matrix}$$

The extended system is subject to a constraint that relates the time to
the new independent variable. We assume the constraint is of the form
/φ/(/τ/; /q_{e}/, /t/; /v_{e}/, /v_{t}/) = /t/ − /f/(/τ/) = 0. The
constraint is <<p396>>a holonomic constraint involving the coordinates
and time, so we can incorporate this constraint by augmenting the
Lagrangian:^{[[#endnote_24][24]]}

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{L_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = L_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;v_{e},v_{t}) + v_{\lambda}(v_{t} - Df(\tau))} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = L(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t})v_{t} + v_{\lambda}(v_{t} - Df(\tau)).} & {(5.263)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Lagrange equations of

$L_{e}^{\prime}$

for /q_{e}/ are satisfied for the paths /q/ ∘ /t/ where /q/ is any path
that satisfies the original Lagrange equations of /L/.

The momenta conjugate to the coordinates are

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{P}_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \partial_{2,0}L_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \partial_{2}L(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \mathcal{P}(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t})} & {(5.264)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{P}_{t}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\, = \partial_{2,1}L_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = L(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t}) - \partial_{2}L(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t})(v_{e}/v_{t}) + v_{\lambda}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = - \mathcal{E}(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t}) + v_{\lambda}} & {(5.265)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{P}_{\lambda}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \partial_{2,2}L_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = v_{t} - Df(\tau).} & {(5.266)} \\
\end{array}$$

So the extended momenta have the same values as the original momenta at
the corresponding states. The momentum conjugate to the time coordinate
is the negation of the energy plus /v_{λ}/. The momentum conjugate to
/λ/ is the constraint, which must be zero.

Next we carry out the transformation to the corresponding Hamiltonian
formulation. First, note that the Lagrangian /L_{e}/ is a homogeneous
form of degree one in the velocities. Thus, by Euler's theorem,

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\partial_{2}L_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;v_{e},v_{t}) \cdot (v_{e},v_{t}) = L_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;v_{e},v_{t}).} & {(5.267)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p397>>

The

$p\overset{˙}{q}\text{-part}$

of the Legendre transform of

$L_{e}^{\prime}$

is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\partial_{2}L_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda}) \cdot (v_{e},v_{t},v_{\lambda})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \partial_{2}L_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;v_{e},v_{t}) \cdot (v_{e},v_{t}) + v_{\lambda}v_{t} + (v_{t} - Df(\tau))v_{\lambda}} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = L_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;v_{e},v_{t}) + v_{\lambda}v_{t} + (v_{t} - Df(\tau))v_{\lambda}.} & {(5.268)} \\
\end{array}$$

So the Hamiltonian

$H_{e}^{\prime}$

corresponding to

$L_{e}^{\prime}$

is

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t,\lambda;p_{e},p_{t},p_{\lambda})} & {= v_{\lambda}v_{t}} & \\
 & {= (p_{t} + H(t,q_{e},p_{e}))(p_{\lambda} + Df(\tau)).} & {(5.269)} \\
\end{array}$$

We have used the fact that at corresponding states the momenta have the
same values, so on paths /p_{e}/ = /p/ ∘ /t/, and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{E}(t,q_{e},v_{e}/v_{t}) = H(t,q_{e},p_{e}).} & {(5.270)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Hamiltonian

$H_{e}^{\prime}$

does not depend on /λ/ so we deduce that /p_{λ}/ is constant. In fact,
/p_{λ}/ must be given the value zero, because it is the constraint. When
there is a cyclic coordinate we can form a reduced Hamiltonian for the
remaining degrees of freedom by substituting the constant value of
conserved momentum conjugate to the cyclic coordinate into the
Hamiltonian. The resulting Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H_{e}(\tau;q_{e},t;p_{e},p_{t}) = (p_{t} + H(t,q_{e},p_{e}))Df(\tau).} & {(5.271)} \\
\end{array}$$

This extended Hamiltonian governs the evolution of the extended system,
for arbitrary /f/.^{[[#endnote_25][25]]}

Hamilton's equations reduce to

$$\begin{array}{rll}
{Dq_{e}(\tau)} & {= \partial_{2}H(t(\tau),q_{e}(\tau),p_{e}(\tau))Df(\tau)} & \\
{Dt(\tau)} & {= Df(\tau)} & \\
{Dp_{e}(\tau)} & {= - \partial_{1}H(t(\tau),q_{e}(\tau),p_{e}(\tau))Df(\tau)} & \\
{Dp_{t}(\tau)} & {= - \partial_{0}H(t(\tau),q_{e}(\tau),p_{e}(\tau))Df(\tau).} & {(5.272)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p398>>

The second equation gives the required relation between /t/ and /τ/. The
first and third equations are equivalent to Hamilton's equations in the
original coordinates, as we can see by using /q_{e}/ = /q/ ∘ /t/ to
rewrite them:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{Dq(t(\tau))Dt(\tau) = \partial_{2}H(t(\tau),q(t(\tau)),p(t(\tau)))Df(\tau)} & \\
{Dp(t(\tau))Dt(\tau) = - \partial_{1}H(t(\tau),q(t(\tau)),p(t(\tau)))Df(\tau).} & {(5.273)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using /Dt/(/τ/) = /Df/(/τ/) and dividing these factors out, we recover
Hamilton's equations.^{[[#endnote_26][26]]}

Now consider the special case for which the time is the same as the
independent variable: /f/(/τ/) = /τ/, /Df/(/τ/) = 1. In this case /q/ =
/q_{e}/ and /p/ = /p_{e}/. The extended Hamiltonian becomes

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;q_{e},t;p_{e},p_{t}) = p_{t} + H(t,q_{e},p_{e}).} & {(5.274)} \\
\end{array}$$

Hamilton's equation for /t/ becomes /Dt/(/τ/) = 1, restating the
constraint. Hamilton's equations for /Dq_{e}/ and /Dp_{e}/ are directly
Hamilton's equations:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{Dq(\tau) = \partial_{2}H(\tau,q(\tau),p(\tau))} & \\
{Dp(\tau) = - \partial_{1}H(\tau,q(\tau),p(\tau)).} & {(5.275)} \\
\end{array}$$

The extended Hamiltonian ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.274][5.274]])
does not depend on the independent variable, so it is a conserved
quantity. Thus, up to an additive constant /p_{t}/ is equal to minus the
energy. The Hamilton's equation for /Dp_{t}/ relates the change of the
energy to ∂_{0}/H/. Note that in the more general case, the momentum
conjugate to the time is not the negation of the energy. This choice,
/t/(/τ/) = /τ/, is useful for a number of applications.

The extension transformation is canonical in the sense that the two sets
of equations of motion describe equivalent dynamics. However, the
transformation is not symplectic; in fact, it does not even have the
same number of input and output variables.

*Exercise 5.16: Homogeneous extended Lagrangian*

exactly the same trajectories that satisfy the original Lagrange
equations for /q/.

*Exercise 5.18: Lorentz transformations*

Investigate Lorentz transformations as point transformations in the
extended phase space.

** *Restricted three-body problem*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: restricted-three-body-problem
   :CLASS: level2
   :END:
An example that shows the utility of reformulating a problem in the
extended phase space is the restricted three-body problem: the motion of
a low-mass particle subject to the gravitational attraction of two other
massive bodies that move in some fixed orbit. The problem is an
idealization of the situation where a body with very small mass moves in
the presence of two bodies with much larger masses. Any effects of the
smaller body on the larger bodies are neglected. In the simplest
version, the motion of all three bodies is assumed to be in the same
plane, and the orbits of the two massive bodies are circular.

The motion of the bodies with larger masses is not influenced by the
small mass, so we model this situation as the small body moving in a
time-varying field of the larger bodies undergoing a prescribed motion.
This situation can be captured as a time-dependent Hamiltonian:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t;x,y;p_{x},p_{y}) = \frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2}}{2m} - \frac{Gmm_{1}}{r_{1}(t)} - \frac{Gmm_{2}}{r_{2}(t)},} & {(5.276)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /r/_{1}(/t/) and /r/_{2}(/t/) are the distances of the small body
to the larger bodies, /m/ is the mass of the small body, and /m/_{1} and
/m/_{2} are the masses of the larger bodies. Note that /r/_{1}(/t/) and
/r/_{2}(/t/) are quantities that depend both on the position of the
small particle and the time-varying position of the massive particles.

The massive bodies are in circular orbits and maintain constant distance
from the center of mass. Let /a/_{1} and /a/_{2} be the distances to the
center of mass; then the distances satisfy /m/_{1}/a/_{1} =
/m/_{2}/a/_{2}. The angular frequency is

$\Omega = \sqrt{G(m_{1} + m_{2})/a^{3}}$

where /a/ is the distance between the masses.

<<p400>>

In polar coordinates, with the center of mass of the subsystem of
massive particles at the origin and with /r/ and /θ/ describing the
position of the low-mass particle, the positions of the two massive
bodies are /a/_{2} = /m/_{1}/a//(/m/_{1}+/m/_{2}) with /θ/_{2} = Ω/t/,
/a/_{1} = /m/_{2}/a//(/m/_{1}+/m/_{2}) with /θ/_{1} = Ω/t/ + /π/. The
distances to the point masses are

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{(r_{2}(t))}^{2} = r^{2} + a_{2}^{2} - 2a_{2}r\,\cos(\theta - \Omega t)} & \\
{{(r_{1}(t))}^{2} = r^{2} + a_{1}^{2} - 2a_{1}r\,\cos(\theta - \Omega t - \pi).} & {(5.277)} \\
\end{array}$$

In polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t;r,\theta;p_{r},p_{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2m}\left( {p_{r}^{2} + \frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{r^{2}}} \right) - \frac{Gmm_{1}}{r_{1}(t)} - \frac{Gmm_{2}}{r_{2}(t)}.} & {(5.278)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Hamiltonian can be written in terms of some function /f/ such that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t;r,\theta;p_{r},p_{\theta}) = f(r,\theta - \Omega t,p_{r},p_{\theta}).} & {(5.279)} \\
\end{array}$$

The essential feature is that /θ/ and /t/ appear in the Hamiltonian only
in the combination /θ/ − Ω/t/.

One way to get rid of the time dependence is to choose a new set of
variables with one coordinate equal to this combination /θ/ − Ω/t/, by
making a point transformation to a rotating coordinate system. We have
shown that

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{r\prime = r} & {(5.280)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\theta\prime = \theta - \Omega t} & {(5.281)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p_{r}^{\prime} = p_{r}} & {(5.282)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p_{\theta}^{\prime} = p_{\theta}} & {(5.283)} \\
\end{array}$$

with

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H\prime(t;r\prime,\theta\prime;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime})} & {= H(t;r\prime,\theta\prime + \Omega t;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime}) - \Omega p_{\theta}^{\prime}} & \\
 & {= f(r\prime,\theta\prime,p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime}) - \Omega p_{\theta}^{\prime}} & {(5.284)} \\
\end{array}$$

is a canonical transformation. The new Hamiltonian, which is not the
energy, is conserved because there is no explicit time dependence. It is
a useful conserved quantity---the Jacobi constant.^{[[#endnote_27][27]]}

<<p401>>

We can also eliminate the dependence on the independent time-like
variable from the Hamiltonian for the restricted problem by going to the
extended phase space, choosing /t/ = /τ/. The Hamiltonian

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{H_{e}(\tau;r,\theta,t;p_{r},p_{\theta},p_{t})} & {= H(t;r,\theta;p_{r},p_{\theta}) + p_{t}} & \\
 & {= f(r,\theta - \Omega t,p_{r},p_{\theta}) + p_{t}} & {(5.285)} \\
\end{array}$$

is autonomous and is consequently a conserved quantity. Again, we see
that /θ/ and /t/ occur only in the combination /θ/ − Ω/t/, which
suggests a point transformation to a new coordinate /θ/′ = /θ/ − Ω/t/.
This point transformation is independent of the new independent variable
/τ/. The transformation is specified in equations
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.280][5.280]]--[[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.283][5.283]]),
augmented by relations specifying how the time coordinate and its
conjugate momentum are handled:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{t = t\prime} & {(5.286)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p_{t} = - \Omega p_{\theta}^{\prime} + p_{t}^{\prime}.} & {(5.287)} \\
\end{array}$$

The new Hamiltonian is obtained by composing the old Hamiltonian with
the transformation:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H_{e}^{\prime}(\tau;r\prime,\theta\prime,t\prime;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime},p_{t}^{\prime})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = H_{e}(\tau;r\prime,\theta\prime + \Omega t\prime,t\prime;p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime},p_{t}^{\prime} - \Omega p_{\theta}^{\prime})} & \\
{\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = f(r\prime,\theta\prime,p_{r}^{\prime},p_{\theta}^{\prime}) + p_{t}^{\prime} - \Omega p_{\theta}^{\prime}.} & {(5.288)} \\
\end{array}$$

We recognize that the new Hamiltonian in the extended phase space, which
has the same value as the original Hamiltonian in the extended phase
space, is just the Jacobi constant plus

$p_{t}^{\prime}$

. The new Hamiltonian does not depend on /t/′, so

$p_{t}^{\prime}$

is a constant of the motion. In fact, its value is irrelevant to the
rest of the dynamical evolution, so we may set the value of

$p_{t}^{\prime}$

to zero if we like. Thus, we have found that the Hamiltonian in the
extended phase space, which is conserved, is just the Jacobi constant
plus an additive arbitrary constant. We have two routes to the Jacobi
constant: (1) transform the original system to a rotating coordinate
system to eliminate the time dependence, but in the process add extra
terms to the Hamiltonian, and (2) go to the extended phase space and
immediately get a conserved quantity, and by going to rotating
coordinates recognize that this Hamiltonian is the same as the
<<p402>>Jacobi constant. So sometimes the Hamiltonian in the extended
phase space is a useful conserved quantity.

*Exercise 5.19: Transformations in the extended phase space*

In [[file:chapter005.html#h3_5-2-1][section 5.2.1]] we found that
time-dependent transformations for which the derivative of the
coordinate--momentum part is symplectic are canonical only if the
Hamiltonian is modified by adding a function /K/ subject to certain
constraints (equation [[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.42][5.42]]). Show
that the constraints on /K/ follow from the symplectic condition in the
extended phase space, using the choice /t/ = /τ/.

    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_5-5-1
    :CLASS: level3
    :END:
The Poincaré invariant ([[file:chapter005.html#h1-30][section 5.3]]) is
especially useful in the extended phase space with /t/ = /τ/. In the
extended phase space the extended Hamiltonian does not depend on the
independent variable. In the extended phase space canonical
transformations are symplectic and the Hamiltonian transforms by
composition.

For the special choice of /t/ = /τ/, equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.90][5.90]]) can be rephrased in an
interesting way. Let /E/ be the value of the Hamiltonian in the original
unextended phase space. Using /q^{n}/ = /t/ and /p_{n}/ = /p_{t}/ =
−/E/, we can write

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}{\int_{R_{i}}{dq^{i}dp_{i} - {\int_{R_{n}}{dtdE = {\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}{{\int_{R_{i}^{\prime}}{dq\prime^{i}dp_{i}^{\prime}}} - {\int_{R_{n}^{\prime}}{dt\prime dE\prime}}}}}}}}} & {(5.289)} \\
\end{array}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\oint_{\partial R}{({\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}{p_{i}dq^{i} - Edt}}) = {\oint_{\partial R\prime}{({\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}{p_{i}^{\prime}dq\prime^{i} - E\prime dt\prime}}).}}}} & {(5.290)} \\
\end{array}$$

The relations ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.289][5.289]]) and
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.290][5.290]]) are two formulations of the
/Poincaré--Cartan integral invariant/.

* *5.6 Reduced Phase Space*
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-33
  :CLASS: level1
  :END:
Suppose we have a system with /n/+1 degrees of freedom described by a
time-independent Hamiltonian in a (2/n/ + 2)-dimensional phase space.
Here we can play the converse game: we can choose <<p403>>any
generalized coordinate to play the role of “time” and the negation of
its conjugate momentum to play the role of a new /n/-degree-of-freedom
time-dependent Hamiltonian in a /reduced phase space/ of 2/n/
dimensions.

More precisely, let

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q = (q^{0},\ldots,q^{n})} & \\
{p = \lbrack p_{0},\ldots,p_{n}\rbrack,} & {(5.291)} \\
\end{array}$$

and suppose we have a system described by a time-independent Hamiltonian

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t,q,p) = f(q,p) = E.} & {(5.292)} \\
\end{array}$$

For each solution path there is a conserved quantity /E/. Let's choose a
coordinate /q^{n}/ to be the time in a reduced phase space. We define
the dynamical variables for the /n/-degree-of-freedom reduced phase
space:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q_{r} = (q_{r}^{0},\ldots,q_{r}^{n - 1})} & \\
{p^{r} = \lbrack p_{0}^{r},\ldots,p_{n - 1}^{r}\rbrack.} & {(5.293)} \\
\end{array}$$

In the original phase space a coordinate such as /q^{n}/ maps time to a
coordinate. In the formulation of the reduced phase space we will have
to use the inverse function /τ/ = (/q^{n}/)^{−1} to map the coordinate
to the time, giving the new coordinates in terms of the new time

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{q_{r}^{i} = q^{i} \circ \tau} & \\
{p_{i}^{r} = p_{i} \circ \tau,} & {(5.294)} \\
\end{array}$$

and thus

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{Dq_{r}^{i} = D(q^{i} \circ \tau) = (Dq^{i} \circ \tau)(D\tau) = (Dq^{i} \circ \tau)/(Dq^{n} \circ \tau)} & \\
{Dp_{i}^{r} = D(p_{i} \circ \tau) = (Dp_{i} \circ \tau)(D\tau) = (Dp_{i} \circ \tau)/(Dq^{n} \circ \tau).} & {(5.295)} \\
\end{array}$$

We propose that a Hamiltonian in the reduced phase space is the negative
of the inverse of /f/(/q/^{0}, ..., /q^{n}/; /p/_{0}, ..., /p_{n}/) =
/E/ with respect to the /p_{n}/ argument:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H_{r}(x,q_{r},p^{r}) = - (\text{the}\, p_{x}\,\text{such that}\, f(q_{r},x;p^{r},p_{x}) = E).} & {(5.296)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p404>>

Note that in the reduced phase space we will have indices for the
structured variables in the range 0 ... /n/−1, whereas in the original
phase space the indices are in the range 0 ... /n/. We will show that
/H_{r}/ is an appropriate Hamiltonian for the given dynamical system in
the reduced phase space. To compute Hamilton's equations we must expand
the implicit definition of /H_{r}/. We define an auxiliary function

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{g(x,q_{r},p^{r}) = f(q_{r},x;p^{r}, - H_{r}(x,q_{r},p^{r})).} & {(5.297)} \\
\end{array}$$

Note that /by construction/ this function is identically a constant /g/
= /E/. Thus all of its partial derivatives are zero:

$$\begin{array}{rll}
{\partial_{0}g} & {= {(\partial_{0}f)}^{n} - {(\partial_{1}f)}^{n}\partial_{0}H_{r} = 0} & \\
{(\partial_{1}g)}_{i} & {= {(\partial_{0}f)}_{i} - {(\partial_{1}f)}^{n}{(\partial_{1}H_{r})}_{i} = 0} & \\
{(\partial_{2}g)}^{i} & {= {(\partial_{1}f)}^{i} - {(\partial_{1}f)}^{n}{(\partial_{2}H_{r})}^{i} = 0,} & {(5.298)} \\
\end{array}$$

where we have suppressed the arguments. Solving for partials of /H_{r}/,
we get

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{{(\partial_{1}H_{r})}_{i} = {(\partial_{0}f)}_{i}/{(\partial_{1}f)}^{n} = {(\partial_{1}H)}_{i}/{(\partial_{2}H)}^{n}} & \\
{{(\partial_{2}H_{r})}^{i} = {(\partial_{1}f)}^{i}/{(\partial_{1}f)}^{n} = {(\partial_{2}H)}^{i}/{(\partial_{2}H)}^{n}.} & {(5.299)} \\
\end{array}$$

Using these relations, we can deduce the Hamilton's equations in the
reduced phase space from the Hamilton's equations in the original phase
space:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{Dq_{r}^{i}(x)} & {= \frac{Dq^{i}(\tau(x))}{Dq^{n}(\tau(x))}} & \\
 & {= \frac{{(\partial_{2}H(\tau(x),q(\tau(x)),p(\tau(x))))}^{i}}{{(\partial_{2}H(\tau(x),q(\tau(x)),p(\tau(x))))}^{n}}} & \\
 & {= {(\partial_{2}H_{r}(x,q_{r}(x),p^{r}(x)))}^{i}} & {(5.300)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{lll}
{Dp_{i}^{r}(x)} & {= \frac{Dp_{i}(\tau(x))}{Dq^{n}(\tau(x))}} & \\
 & {= \frac{- {(\partial_{1}H(\tau(x),q(\tau(x)),p(\tau(x))))}_{i}}{{(\partial_{2}H(\tau(x),q(\tau(x)),p(\tau(x))))}^{n}}} & \\
 & {= - {(\partial_{1}H_{r}(x,q_{r}(x),p^{r}(x)))}_{i}.} & {(5.301)} \\

** *Orbits in a central field*
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: orbits-in-a-central-field

   :END:
Consider planar motion in a central field. We have already seen this
expressed in polar coordinates in equation
([[file:chapter003.html#disp_3.100][3.100]]):

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t;r,\varphi;p_{r},p_{\varphi}) = \frac{p_{r}^{2}}{2m} + \frac{p_{\varphi}^{2}}{2mr^{2}} + V(r).} & {(5.302)} \\
\end{array}$$

There are two degrees of freedom and the Hamiltonian is time
independent. Thus the energy, the value of the Hamiltonian, is conserved
on realizable paths. Let's forget about time and reparameterize this
system in terms of the orbital radius /r/.^{[[#endnote_28][28]]} To do
this we solve

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H(t;r,\varphi;p_{r},p_{\varphi}) = E} & {(5.303)} \\
\end{array}$$

for /p_{r}/, obtaining

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(r,\varphi,p_{\varphi}) = - p_{r} = - \left( {2m(E - V(r)) - \frac{p_{\varphi}^{2}}{r^{2}}} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}},} & {(5.304)} \\
\end{array}$$

which is the Hamiltonian in the reduced phase space.

Hamilton's equations are now quite simple:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{d\varphi}{dr} = \frac{\partial H\prime}{\partial p_{\varphi}} = \frac{p_{\varphi}}{r^{2}}\left( {2m(E - V(r)) - \frac{p_{\varphi}^{2}}{r^{2}}} \right)^{- \frac{1}{2}}} & {(5.305)} \\
\end{array}$$

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{dp_{\varphi}}{dr} = - \frac{\partial H\prime}{\partial\varphi} = 0.} & {(5.306)} \\
\end{array}$$

The momentum /p_{φ}/ is independent of /r/ (as it was with /t/), so for
any particular orbit we may define a constant angular momentum /L/. Thus
our problem ends up as a simple quadrature:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\varphi(r) = {\int_{}^{r}{\frac{L}{r^{2}}\left( {2m(E - V(r)) - \frac{L^{2}}{r^{2}}} \right)^{- \frac{1}{2}}dr + \varphi_{0}.}}} & {(5.307)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p406>>

To see the utility of this procedure, we continue our example with a
definite potential energy---a gravitating point mass:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{V(r) = - \frac{\mu}{r}.} & {(5.308)} \\
\end{array}$$

When we substitute this into equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.307][5.307]]) we obtain a mess that can
be simplified to

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\varphi(r) = L\,{\int_{}^{r}{\frac{dr}{r\sqrt{2mEr^{2} + 2m\mu r - L^{2}}} + \varphi_{0}.}}} & {(5.309)} \\
\end{array}$$

Integrating this, we obtain another mess, which can be simplified and
rearranged to obtain the following:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{1}{r} = \frac{m\mu}{L^{2}}\left( {1 - \sqrt{1 + \frac{2EL^{2}}{m\mu^{2}}}\,\sin\,(\varphi(r) - \varphi_{0})} \right).} & {(5.310)} \\
\end{array}$$

This can be recognized as the polar-coordinate form of the equation of a
conic section with eccentricity /e/ and parameter /p/:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1 + e\,\cos\,\theta}{p}} & {(5.311)} \\
\end{array}$$

where

$$\begin{array}{ll}
\begin{array}{llll}
{e = \sqrt{1 + \frac{2EL^{2}}{m\mu^{2}}},} & {p = \frac{L^{2}}{m\mu}} & \text{and} & {\theta = \varphi_{0} - \varphi(r) - \frac{\pi}{2}.} \\
\end{array} & {(5.312)} \\
\end{array}$$

In fact, if the orbit is an ellipse with semimajor axis /a/, we have

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{p = a(1 - e^{2})} & {(5.313)} \\
\end{array}$$

and so we can identify the role of energy and angular momentum in
shaping the ellipse:

$$\begin{array}{llll}
{E = - \frac{\mu}{2a}} & \text{and} & {L = \sqrt{m\mu a(1 - e^{2})}.} & {(5.314)} \\
\end{array}$$

What we get from analysis in the reduced phase space is the geometry of
the trajectory, but we lose the time-domain behavior. The reduction is
often worth the price.

<<p407>>

Although we have treated time in a special way so far, we have found
that time is not special. It can be included in the coordinates to make
a driven system autonomous. And it can be eliminated from any autonomous
system in favor of any other coordinate. This leads to numerous
strategies for simplifying problems, by removing time variation and then
performing canonical transforms on the resulting conservative autonomous
system to make a nice coordinate that we can then dump back into the
role of time.

** *Generating functions in extended phase space*

We can represent canonical transformations with mixed-variable
generating functions. We can extend these to represent transformations
in the extended phase space. Let /F/_{2} be a generating function with
arguments (/t/, /q/, /p/′). Then, the corresponding

$F_{2}^{e}$

in the extended phase space can be taken to be

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{F_{2}^{e}(\tau;q,t;p\prime,p_{t}^{\prime}) = tp_{t}^{\prime} + F_{2}(t,q,p).} & {(5.315)} \\
\end{array}$$

The relations between the coordinates and the momenta are the same as
before. We also have

$$\begin{array}{rll}
p_{t} & {= {(\partial_{1}F_{2}^{e})}_{n}(\tau;q,t;p\prime,p_{t}^{\prime}) = p_{t}^{\prime} + \partial_{0}F_{2}(t,q,p)} & \\
{t\prime} & {= {(\partial_{2}F_{2}^{e})}^{n}(\tau;q,t;p\prime,p_{t}^{\prime}) = t.} & {(5.316)} \\
\end{array}$$

The first equation gives the relationship between the original
Hamiltonians:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H\prime(t,q\prime,p\prime) = H(t,q,p) + \partial_{0}F_{2}(t,q,p),} & {(5.317)} \\
\end{array}$$

as required. Time-independent canonical transformations, where /H/′ =
/H/ ∘ /C/_{H}, have symplectic /qp/ part. The generating-function
representation of a time-dependent transformation does not depend on the
independent variable in the extended phase space. So, in extended phase
space the /qp/ part of the transformation, which includes the time and
the momentum conjugate to time, is symplectic.

*Exercise 5.20: Rotating coordinates in extended phase space*

In the extended phase space the time is one of the coordinates. Carry
out the transformation to rotating coordinates using an /F/_{2}-type
generating function in the extended phase space. Compare Hamiltonian
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.178][5.178]]) to the Hamiltonian obtained
by composition with the transformation.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-34

Canonical transformations can be used to reformulate a problem in
coordinates that are easier to understand or that expose some symmetry
of a problem.

In this chapter we have investigated different representations of a
dynamical system. We have found that different representations will be
equivalent if the coordinate--momentum part of the transformation has a
symplectic derivative, and if the Hamiltonian transforms in a specified
way. If the phase-space transformation is time independent, then the
Hamiltonian transforms by composition with the phase-space
transformation. The symplectic condition can be equivalently expressed
in terms of the fundamental Poisson brackets. The Poisson bracket and
the /ω/ function are invariant under canonical transformations. The
invariance of /ω/ implies that the sum of the areas of the projections
onto fundamental coordinate--momentum planes is preserved (Poincaré
integral invariant) by canonical transformations.

A generating function is a real-valued function of the phase-space
coordinates and time that represents a canonical transformation through
its partial derivatives. We found that every canonical transformation
can be represented by a generating function. The proof depends on the
Poincaré integral invariant.

We can formulate an extended phase space in which time is treated as
another coordinate. Time-dependent transformations are simple in the
extended phase space. In the extended phase space the Poincaré integral
invariant is the Poincaré--Cartan integral invariant. We can also
reformulate a time-independent problem as a time-dependent problem with
fewer degrees of freedom, with one of the original coordinates taking on
the role of time; this is the reduced phase space.

*Exercise 5.21: Hierarchical Jacobi coordinates*

A Hamiltonian for the /n/-body problem is

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{H = T + V} & {(5.318)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p409>>

with

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{T(t;x_{0,}x_{1},\ldots,x_{n - 1};p_{0},p_{1},\ldots,p_{n - 1}) = {\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\frac{p_{i}^{2}}{2m_{i}}}} & {(5.319)} \\
\end{array}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{V(t;x_{0},x_{1},\ldots,x_{n - 1};p_{0},p_{1},\ldots,p_{n - 1}) = {\sum\limits_{i < j}{f_{ij}\left( \left\| {x_{i} - x_{j}} \right\| \right)}},} & {(5.320)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /x_{i}/ is the tuple of rectangular coordinates for body /i/ and
/p_{i}/ is the tuple of conjugate linear momenta for body /i/.

The potential energy of the system depends only on the relative
positions of the bodies, so the relative motion decouples from the
center of mass motion. In this problem we explore canonical
transformations that achieve this decoupling.

*a.* Canonical heliocentric coordinates. The coordinates transform as
follows:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x_{0}^{\prime} = X,} & {(5.321)} \\
\end{array}$$

where /X/ is the center of mass of the system, and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x_{i}^{\prime} = x_{i} - x_{0},} & {(5.322)} \\
\end{array}$$

for /i/ > 0, the differences of the position of body /i/ and the body
with index 0 (which might be the Sun). Find the associated canonical
momenta using an /F/_{2}-type generating function. Show that the
potential energy can be written solely in terms of the coordinates for
/i/ > 0. Show that the kinetic energy is not in the form of a sum of
squares of momenta divided by mass constants.

*b.* Jacobi coordinates. The Jacobi coordinates isolate the center of
mass motion, without spoiling the usual diagonal quadratic form of the
kinetic energy. Define /X_{i}/ to be the center of mass of the bodies
with indices less than or equal to /i/:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{X_{i} = \frac{\sum_{j = 0}^{i}{m_{j}x_{j}}}{\sum_{j = 0}^{i}m_{j}}.} & {(5.323)} \\
\end{array}$$

The Jacobi coordinates are defined by

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x_{i - 1}^{\prime} = x_{i} - X_{i - 1},} & {(5.324)} \\
\end{array}$$

for 0 < /i/ < /n/, and

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{x_{n - 1}^{\prime} = X_{n - 1}.} & {(5.325)} \\
\end{array}$$

<<p410>>

The coordinates

$x_{i}^{\prime}$

for 0 < /i/ < /n/ are the difference of the position of body /i/ − 1 and
the center of mass of bodies with lower indices; the coordinate

$x_{n - 1}^{\prime}$

is the center of mass of the system. Complete the canonical
transformation by finding the conjugate momenta using an /F/_{2}-type
generating function. Show that the kinetic energy can still be written
in the form

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{T(t;x_{0}^{\prime},x_{1}^{\prime},\ldots,x_{n - 1}^{\prime};p_{0}^{\prime},p_{1}^{\prime},\ldots,p_{n - 1}^{\prime}) = {\sum\limits_{i = 0}^{n - 1}{\frac{{p_{i}^{\prime}}^{2}}{2m_{i}^{\prime}},}}} & {(5.326)} \\
\end{array}$$

for some constants

$m_{i}^{\prime}$

, and that the potential /V/ can be written solely in terms of the
Jacobi coordinates

$x_{i}^{\prime}$

with indices /i/ > 0.

*c.* Hierarchical Jacobi coordinates. Define a “body” as a tuple of a
mass and a rectangular position tuple. An /n/-body “system” is a tuple
of /n/ bodies: (/b/_{0}, /b/_{1}, ..., /b/_{/n/−1}). Define a “linking”
transformation

$\mathcal{L}_{jk}$

for bodies /j/ and /k/ that takes an /n/-body system and returns a new
linked system:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(b_{0}^{\prime},\ldots,b_{n - 1}^{\prime}) = \mathcal{L}_{jk}(b_{0},\ldots,b_{n - 1}).} & {(5.327)} \\
\end{array}$$

The bodies in the new system are the same as the bodies in the old
system

$b_{i}^{\prime} = b_{i}$

except for bodies /j/ and /k/:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{(m_{j}^{\prime},x_{j}^{\prime}) = (m_{j}m_{k}/(m_{j} + m_{k}),x_{k} - x_{j})} & \\
{(m_{k}^{\prime},x_{k}^{\prime}) = (m_{j} + m_{k},(m_{j}x_{j} + m_{k}x_{k})/(m_{j} + m_{k})).} & {(5.328)} \\
\end{array}$$

This is a transformation to relative coordinates and center of mass for
bodies /j/ and /k/. Extend this transformation to phase space and show
that it preserves the form of the kinetic energy

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\sum\limits_{i}{\frac{{(p_{i})}^{2}}{2m_{i}} = {\sum\limits_{i}{\frac{{(p_{i}^{\prime})}^{2}}{2m_{i}^{\prime}}.}}}} & {(5.329)} \\
\end{array}$$

Show that the transformation to Jacobi coordinates of part *b* is
generated by a composition of linking transformations:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
{\mathcal{L}_{n - 2,n - 1} \circ \cdots \circ \mathcal{L}_{1,2} \circ \mathcal{L}_{0,1}.} & {(5.330)} \\
\end{array}$$

Interpret the coordinate transformation produced by such a succession of
linking transformations; why do we call this a “linking” transformation?
What requirement has to be satisfied for a composition of linking
transformations to isolate the center of mass of the system (make it one
of the coordinates)? Taking this constraint into account, find
hierarchical Jacobi coordinates for a system with six bodies, arranged
as two triple systems, each of which is a binary plus a third body.
Verify that one of the coordinates is the center of mass of the system,
and that the kinetic energy remains a sum of squares of the momenta
divided by an appropriate mass constant.

[[#endnote_ref_1][^{1}]] Solving for /p/ in terms of /p/′ involves
multiplying equation ([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.3][5.3]]) on the
right by (∂_{1}/F/(/t/, /q/′))^{−1}. This inverse is the structure that
when multiplying ∂_{1}/F/(/t/, /q/′) on the right gives an identity
structure. Structures representing linear transformations may be
represented in terms of matrices. In this case, the matrix
representation of the inverse structure is the inverse of the matrix
representing the given structure.

[[#endnote_ref_2][^{2}]]In chapter 1 the transformation /C/ takes a
local tuple in one coordinate system and gives a local tuple in another

[[#endnote_ref_3][^{3}]]The velocities and the momenta are dual
geometric objects with respect to time-independent point
transformations. The velocities are coordinates of a vector field on the
configuration manifold, and the momenta are coordinates of a covector
field on the configuration manifold. The invariance of the inner product
/pv/ under time-independent point transformations provides a motivation
for our use of superscripts for velocity components and subscripts for
momentum components.

[[#endnote_ref_4][^{4}]]The procedure solve-linear-right multiplies its
first argument by the inverse of its second argument on the right. So,
if /u/ = /vM/ then /v/ = /uM/^{−1}; (solve-linear-right u M) produces v.

[[#endnote_ref_5][^{5}]]/D_{s}/ is not a derivative operator. It is not
linear because the time component is a nonzero constant.

[[#endnote_ref_6][^{6}]]Sometimes we use a center dot to indicate
multiplication, to avoid the ambiguity of the use of juxtaposition to
indicate both multiplication and function application. This is not to be
interpreted as a vector dot product.

[[#endnote_ref_7][^{7}]]Actually, for /I/ = 0 the transform is not well
defined and so it is not canonical for that value. This transformation
is “locally canonical” in that it is canonical for nonzero values of
/I/. We will ignore this essentially topological problem.

[[#endnote_ref_8][^{8}]]Unlike /D_{s}/,

$\mathcal{D}$

is linear and can be a derivative operator.

[[#endnote_ref_9][^{9}]]The procedure zero-like produces a structure of
zeros with the shape of its argument.

[[#endnote_ref_10][^{10}]]This is just a rearrangement of the arguments
of /R_{z}/: /R/(Ω)(/t/, /q/′) = /R_{z}/(Ω/t/)(/q/′).

[[#endnote_ref_11][^{11}]]For each linear transformation /T/ : /A/ → /A/
of incremental phase-space states there is a unique linear
transformation

$T^{\mathcal{T}}:A^{\star}\rightarrow A^{\star}$

of the dual space, called the /transpose/ of /T/, such that for every
real-valued linear function /g/ : /A/ → *R* of incremental phase-space
states, and for every /a/ ∈ /A/ we have

$(T^{\mathcal{T}}(g))(a) = g(T(a))$

. As linear multipliers

${(DT(a))}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot Dg(a) \cdot a = Dg(a) \cdot DT(a) \cdot a$

. But for arbitrary /a/ this is

${(DT(a))}^{\mathcal{T}} \cdot Dg(a) = Dg(a) \cdot DT(a)$

. In our application, /DT/ (/a/) is /DC/_{H}(/s/′), and /Dg/(/a/) is
/DH/(/C/_{H}(/s/′)).

[[#endnote_ref_12][^{12}]]The procedure compatible-shape takes any
structure and produces another structure that is guaranteed to multiply
with the given structure to produce a numerical quantity. For example,
the shape of /DH/(/s/) is a compatible shape to the shape of /s/: if
they are multiplied the result is a numerical quantity. This is the
/s/^{⋆} that appears in equation
([[file:chapter005.html#disp_5.48][5.48]]).

[[#endnote_ref_13][^{13}]]The procedure transpose is simply defined for
traditional matrices, but because structures that specify linear
transformations may have arbitrary substructure, the procedure needs to
be supplied with a template that specifies this structure. So the
procedure transpose takes two arguments: (transpose ms rs), where ms is
the structure to be transposed and the template rs is a structure that
is appropriate for multiplication with ms on the right.

[[#endnote_ref_14][^{14}]]Actually, this is more interesting: we allow
transformations that arbitrarily distort time, as tau is an arbitrary
literal function. The canonical condition is concerned only with the
possibly time-dependent transformation of coordinates and momenta.

[[#endnote_ref_15][^{15}]]The /qp/ submatrix of a square matrix of
dimension 2/n/ + 1 is the 2/n/-dimensional matrix obtained by deleting
the first row and the first column of the given matrix. This can be
computed by:

{% highlight scheme %} (define (qp-submatrix m) (m:submatrix m 1
(m:num-rows m) 1 (m:num-cols m))) {% endhighlight %}

[[#endnote_ref_16][^{16}]]The procedure D-as-matrix is defined as:

{% highlight scheme %} (define ((D-as-matrix F) s) (s->m
(compatible-shape (F s)) ((D F) s) s))) {% endhighlight %}

[[#endnote_ref_17][^{17}]]The /q^{i}/, /p_{i}/ plane is the /i/th
/canonical plane/ in these phase-space variables.

[[#endnote_ref_18][^{18}]]The structure ∂_{2}∂_{1}/F/_{1} is a down of
downs, so it is compatible for contraction with an up on either side.
But it is not symmetrical, so the associations must be specified. To
solve this problem we use index notation (ugh!).

So we use indices to select particular components of structured objects.
If an index symbol appears both as a superscript and as a subscript in
an expression, the value of the expression is the sum over all possible
values of the index symbol of the designated components (Einstein
summation convention). Thus, for example, if

$\overset{˙}{q}$

and /p/ are of dimension /n/ then the indicated product

$p_{i}{\overset{˙}{q}}^{i}$

is to be interpreted as

$\Sigma_{i = 0}^{n - 1}p_{i}{\overset{˙}{q}}^{i}$

.

[[#endnote_ref_19][^{19}]]A structure is nonsingular if the determinant
of the matrix representation of the structure is nonzero.

[[#endnote_ref_20][^{20}]]Point transformations are not in this class:
we cannot solve for the momenta in terms of the positions for point
transformations, because for a point transformation the primed and
unprimed coordinates can be deduced from each other, so there is not
enough information in the coordinates to deduce the momenta.

[[#endnote_ref_21][^{21}]]Let /F/ be defined as the path-independent
line integral

$F\left( x \right) = {\int_{x_{0}}^{x}{\sum\limits_{i}{f_{i}\left( x \right)dx^{i} + F\left( x_{0} \right);}}}$

then ∂/_{i}F/(/x/) = /f_{i}/(/x/).

[[#endnote_ref_22][^{22}]]There may be some singular cases and
topological problems that prevent this from being rigorously true.

[[#endnote_ref_23][^{23}]]The various generating functions are
traditionally known by the names /F/_{1}, /F/_{2}, /F/_{3}, and /F/_{4}.
Please don't blame us.

[[#endnote_ref_24][^{24}]]We augment the Lagrangian with the total time
derivative of the constraint so that the Legendre transform will be well
defined.

[[#endnote_ref_25][^{25}]]Once we have made this reduction, taking
/p_{λ}/ to be zero, we can no longer perform a Legendre transform back
to the extended Lagrangian system; we cannot solve for /p_{t}/ in terms
of /v_{t}/. However, the Legendre transform in the extended system from

$H_{e}^{\prime}$

to

$L_{e}^{\prime}$

, with associated state variables, is well defined.

[[#endnote_ref_26][^{26}]]If /f/ is strictly increasing then /Df/ is
never zero.

[[#endnote_ref_27][^{27}]]Actually, the traditional Jacobi constant is
/C/ = −2/H/′.

[[#endnote_ref_28][^{28}]]We could have chosen to reparameterize in
terms of /φ/, but then both /p_{r}/ and /r/ would occur in the resulting
time-independent Hamiltonian. The path we have chosen takes advantage of
the fact that /φ/ does not appear in our Hamiltonian, so /p_{φ}/ is a
constant of the motion. This structure suggests that to solve this kind
of problem we need to look ahead, as in playing chess.
