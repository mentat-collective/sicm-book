The Principle of Least Action

  “The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present
  the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the
  whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually
  originated. In the interest of clearness, it appeared to me inevitable
  that I should repeat myself frequently, without paying the slightest
  attention to the elegance of the presentation. I adhered scrupulously
  to the precept of that brilliant theoretical physicist L. Boltzmann,
  according to whom matters of elegance ought be left to the tailor and
  to the cobbler.”

  Albert Einstein, in /Relativity, the Special and General Theory/,
  (1961), p. v
