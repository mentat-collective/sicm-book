  Having treated the motion of the moon about the earth, and having
  obtained an elliptical orbit, [Newton] considered the effect of the
  sun on the moon's orbit by taking into account the variations of the
  latter. However, the calculations caused him great difficulties ...
  Indeed, the problems he encountered were such that [Newton] was
  prompted to remark to the astronomer John Machin that “... his head
  never ached but with his studies on the moon.”

  Closed-form solutions of dynamical systems can be found only rarely.
  However, some systems differ from a solvable system by the addition of
  a small effect. The goal of perturbation theory is to relate aspects
  of the motion of the given system to those of the nearby solvable
  system. We can try to find a way to transform the exact solution of
  this approximate problem into an approximate solution to the original
  problem. We can also use perturbation theory to try to predict
  qualitative features of the solutions by describing the characteristic
  ways in which solutions of the solvable system are distorted by the
  additional effects. For instance, we might want to predict where the
  largest resonance regions are located or the locations and sizes of
  the largest chaotic zones. Being able to predict such features can
  give insight into the behavior of the particular system of interest.

  Suppose, for example, we have a system characterized by a Hamiltonian
  that breaks up into two parts as follows:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H = H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1},} & \left( 7.1 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /H/_{0} is solvable and /ϵ/ is a small parameter. The difference
  between our system and a solvable system is then a small additive
  complication.

  <<p458>>

  There are a number of strategies for doing this. One strategy is to
  seek a canonical transformation that eliminates from the Hamiltonian
  the terms of order /ϵ/ that impede solution---this typically
  introduces new terms of order /ϵ/^{2}. Then one seeks another
  canonical transformation that eliminates the terms of order /ϵ/^{2}
  impeding solution, leaving terms of order /ϵ/^{3}. We can imagine
  repeating this process until the part that impedes solution is of such
  high order in /ϵ/ that it can be neglected. Having reduced the problem
  to a solvable problem, we can reverse the sequence of transformations
  to find an approximate solution of the original problem. Does this
  process converge? How do we know we can ever neglect the remaining
  terms? Let's follow this path and see where it goes.

  * *7.1 Perturbation Theory with Lie Series*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h1-42
    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  Given a system, we look for a decomposition of the Hamiltonian in the
  form

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H\left( {t,q,p} \right) = H_{0}\left( {t,q,p} \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1}\left( {t,q,p} \right),} & \left( 7.2 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /H/_{0} is solvable. We assume that the Hamiltonian has no
  explicit time dependence; this can be ensured by going to the extended
  phase space if necessary. We also assume that a canonical
  transformation has been made so that /H/_{0} depends solely on the
  momenta:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\partial_{1}H_{0} = 0.} & \left( 7.3 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  We carry out a Lie transformation and find the conditions that the Lie
  generator /W/ must satisfy to eliminate the order /ϵ/ terms from the
  Hamiltonian.

  The Lie transform and associated Lie series specify a canonical
  transformation:

  $$\begin{array}{rll}
  {H\prime} & {= E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}H = e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}H} & \\
  q & {= {({E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}Q})}{({t,q\prime,p\prime})} = {({e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}Q})}{({t,q\prime,p\prime})}} & \\
  p & {= {({E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}P})}{({t,q\prime,p\prime})} = {({e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}P})}{({t,q\prime,p\prime})}} & \\
  {({t,q,p})} & {= {({E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I})}{({t,q\prime,p\prime})} = {({e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}I})}{({t,q\prime,p\prime})},} & {(7.4)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  <<p459>>

  where /Q/ = /I/_{1} and /P/ = /I/_{2} are the coordinate and momentum
  selectors and /I/ is the identity function. Recall the definitions

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}F} & {= F + \mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}F + \frac{1}{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W}^{2}F + \cdots} & \\
   & {= F + \mathit{\epsilon}\left\{ {F,W} \right\} + \frac{1}{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left\{ {\left\{ {F,W} \right\},W} \right\} + \cdots,} & \left( 7.5 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  with /L_{W}F/ = {/F/, /W/ }.

  Applying the Lie transformation to /H/ gives us

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H\prime} & {= e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}H} & \\
   & {= H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}H_{0} + \frac{1}{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W}^{2}H_{0} + \cdots} & \\
   & {\text{           } + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1} + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W}H_{1} + \cdots} & \\
   & {= H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}\left( {L_{W}H_{0} + H_{1}} \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( {\frac{1}{2}L_{W}^{2}H_{0} + L_{W}H_{1}} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.6 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  The first-order term in /ϵ/ is zero if /W/ satisfies the condition

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {L_{W}H_{0} + H_{1} = 0,} & \left( 7.7 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  which is a linear partial differential equation for /W/. The
  transformed Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H\prime} & {= H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( {\frac{1}{2}L_{W}^{2}H_{0} + L_{W}H1} \right) + \cdots} & \\
   & {= H_{0} + \frac{1}{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W}H_{1} + \cdots,} & \left( 7.8 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  where we have used condition ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.7][7.7]])
  to simplify the /ϵ/^{2} contribution.

  This basic step of perturbation theory has eliminated terms of a
  certain order (order /ϵ/) from the Hamiltonian, but in doing so has
  generated new terms of higher order (here /ϵ/^{2} and higher).

  At this point we can find an approximate solution by truncating
  Hamiltonian ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.8][7.8]]) to /H/_{0}, which
  is solvable. The approximate solution for given initial conditions
  /s/_{0} = (/t/_{0}, /q/_{0}, /p/_{0}) is obtained by finding the
  corresponding

  $\left( {t_{0},q_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}} \right)$

  using the inverse of transformation
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.4][7.4]]). Then the system is evolved
  to time /t/ using the solutions of the truncated Hamiltonian /H/_{0},
  giving the state (/t/, /q/′, /p/′). The phase-space coordinates of the
  evolved point are transformed back to the original variables using the
  transformation ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.4][7.4]]) to
  <<p460>>state /s/ = (/t/, /q/, /p/). The approximate solution is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  s & {= \left( {\left( {E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I} \right) \circ \left( {E_{t - t_{0},H_{0}}I} \right) \circ \left( {E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I} \right)} \right)\left( s_{0} \right)} & \\
   & {= \left( {E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}E_{t - t_{0},H_{0}}E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I} \right)\left( s_{0} \right)} & \\
   & {= \left( {e^{- \mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}e^{{({t - t_{0}})}D_{H_{0}}}e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}I} \right)\left( s_{0} \right),} & \left( 7.9 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  using the identity ([[file:chapter006.html#disp_6.111][6.111]]).
  Notice that the time evolution of /H/_{0} is expressed in terms of the
  evolution operator /E/ rather than the Lie-transform operator /E/′,
  because the time must also be advanced. The power-series expansion for

  $E_{\Delta t,H_{0}}$

  is expressed in terms of

  $D_{H_{0}}$

  rather than

  $L_{H_{0}}$

  (see [[file:chapter006.html#disp_6.136][6.136]]). If the Lie transform

  $E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime} = e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}$

  must be evaluated by summing the series, then we must specify the
  order to which the sum extends.

  Assuming everything goes okay, we can imagine repeating this process
  to eliminate the order /ϵ/^{2} terms and so on, bringing the
  transformed Hamiltonian as close as we like to /H/_{0}. Unfortunately,
  there are complications. We can understand some of these complications
  and how to deal with them by considering some specific applications.

  * *7.2 Pendulum as a Perturbed Rotor*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h1-42a
    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  The pendulum is a simple one-degree-of-freedom system, for which the
  solutions are known. If we consider the pendulum as a free rotor with
  the added complication of gravity, then we can carry out a
  perturbation step as just described to see how well it approximates
  the known motion of the pendulum.

  The motion of a pendulum is described by the Hamiltonian

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} - \mathit{\epsilon}\beta\cos\left( \theta \right),} & \left( 7.10 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  with coordinate /θ/ and conjugate angular momentum /p/, where /α/ =
  /ml/^{2} and /β/ = /mgl/. The parameter /ϵ/ allows us to scale the
  perturbation; it is 1 for the actual pendulum. We divide the
  Hamiltonian into the free-rotor Hamiltonian and the perturbation from
  gravity:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H = H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1},} & \left( 7.11 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  <<p461>>

  where

  $$\begin{array}{rll}
  {H_{0}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right)} & {= \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha}} & \\
  {\mathit{\epsilon}H_{1}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right)} & {= - \mathit{\epsilon}\beta\cos\theta.} & \left( 7.12 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  The Lie generator /W/ satisfies condition
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.7][7.7]]):

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\left\{ {H_{0},W} \right\} + H_{1} = 0,} & \left( 7.13 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  or

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {- \frac{p}{\alpha}\partial_{1}W\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) - \beta\cos\theta = 0.} & \left( 7.14 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  So

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = - \frac{\alpha\beta\sin\theta}{p},} & \left( 7.15 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where the arbitrary integration constant is ignored.

  The transformed Hamiltonian is /H/′ = /H/_{0} + /o/(/ϵ/^{2}). If we
  can ignore the /ϵ/^{2} contributions, then the transformed Hamiltonian
  is simply

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H\prime\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) = \frac{\left( p\prime \right)^{2}}{2\alpha},} & \left( 7.16 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  with solutions

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\theta\prime} & {= \theta_{0}^{\prime} + \frac{p_{0}^{\prime}}{\alpha}\left( {t - t_{0}} \right)} & \\
  {p\prime} & {= p_{0}^{\prime}.} & \left( 7.17 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  To connect these solutions to the solutions of the original problem,
  we use the Lie series

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  \theta & {= \left( {e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}Q} \right)\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right)} & \\
   & {= \theta\prime + \mathit{\epsilon}\left\{ {Q,W} \right\}\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) + \cdots} & \\
   & {= \theta\prime + \mathit{\epsilon}\partial_{2}W\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) + \cdots} & \\
   & {= \theta\prime + \mathit{\epsilon}\frac{\alpha\beta\sin\theta\prime}{\left( p\prime \right)^{2}} + \cdots.} & \left( 7.18 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  <<p462>>

  Similarly,

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {p = p\prime + \mathit{\epsilon}\frac{\alpha\beta\cos\theta\prime}{p\prime} + \cdots.} & \left( 7.19 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Note that if the Lie series is truncated it is not exactly a canonical
  transformation; only the infinite series is canonical.

  The initial values

  $\theta_{0}^{\prime}$

  and

  $p_{0}^{\prime}$

  are determined from the initial values of /θ/ and /p/ by the inverse
  Lie transformation:

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\theta\prime} & {= \left( {e^{- \mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}Q} \right)\left( {t,\theta,p} \right)} & \\
   & {= \theta - \mathit{\epsilon}\frac{\alpha\beta\sin\theta}{\left( p \right)^{2}} + \cdots} & \left( 7.20 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  and

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {p\prime = p - \mathit{\epsilon}\frac{\alpha\beta\cos\theta}{p} + \cdots.} & \left( 7.21 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Note that if we truncate the coordinate transformations after the
  first-order terms in /ϵ/ (or any finite order), then the inverse
  transformation is not exactly the inverse of the transformation.

  The approximate solution for given initial conditions (/t/_{0},
  /θ/_{0}, /p/_{0}) is obtained by finding the corresponding

  $\left( {t_{0},\theta_{0}^{\prime},p_{0}^{\prime}} \right)$

  using the transformation ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.20][7.20]])
  and ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.21][7.21]]). Then the system is
  evolved using the solutions
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.17][7.17]]). The phase-space
  coordinates of the evolved point are transformed back to the original
  variables using the transformation
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.18][7.18]]) and
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.19][7.19]]).

  We define the two parts of the pendulum Hamiltonian:

  {% highlight scheme %} (define ((H0 alpha) state) (let ((p (momentum
  state))) (/ (square p) (* 2 alpha)))) (define ((H1 beta) state) (let
  ((theta (coordinate state))) (* -1 beta (cos theta)))) {% endhighlight
  %}

  The Hamiltonian for the pendulum can be expressed as a series
  expansion in the parameter /ϵ/ by

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (H-pendulum-series alpha beta epsilon)
  (series (H0 alpha) (* epsilon (H1 beta)))) {% endhighlight %}

  where the series procedure is a constructor for a series whose first
  terms are given and all further terms are zero. The Lie generator that
  eliminates the order /ϵ/ terms is

  {% highlight scheme %} (define ((W alpha beta) state) (let ((theta
  (coordinate state)) (p (momentum state))) (/ (* -1 alpha beta (sin
  theta)) p))) {% endhighlight %}

  We check that W satisfies condition
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.7][7.7]]):

  {% highlight scheme %} ((+ ((Lie-derivative (W 'alpha 'beta)) (H0
  'alpha)) (H1 'beta)) (up 't 'theta 'p)) {% endhighlight %}

  {% highlight scheme %} 0 {% endhighlight %}

  and that it has the desired effect on the Hamiltonian:

  {% highlight scheme %} (show-expression (series:sum (((exp (* 'epsilon
  (Lie-derivative (W 'alpha 'beta)))) (H-pendulum-series 'alpha 'beta
  'epsilon)) (up 't 'theta 'p)) 2)) {% endhighlight %}

  $$\frac{\frac{1}{2}p^{2}}{\alpha} + \frac{\frac{1}{2}\alpha\beta^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( {\sin\left( \theta \right)} \right)^{2}}{p^{2}}$$

  Indeed, the order /ϵ/ term has been removed and an order /ϵ/^{2} term
  has been introduced.

  Ignoring the /ϵ/^{2} terms in the new Hamiltonian, the solution is

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (((solution0 alpha beta) t) state0)
  (let ((t0 (time state0)) (theta0 (coordinate state0)) (p0 (momentum
  state0))) (up t (+ theta0 (/ (* (- t t0) p0) alpha)) p0))) {%
  endhighlight %}

  The transformation from primed to unprimed phase-space coordinates is,
  including terms up to order,

  {% highlight scheme %} (define ((C alpha beta epsilon order) state)
  (series:sum (((Lie-transform (W alpha beta) epsilon) identity) state)
  order)) {% endhighlight %}

  <<p464>>

  To second order in /ϵ/ the transformation generated by W is

  {% highlight scheme %} (show-expression ((C 'alpha 'beta 'epsilon 2)
  (up 't 'theta 'p))) {% endhighlight %}

  $$\begin{pmatrix}
  t \\
  {- \frac{\frac{1}{2}\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\cos\left( \theta \right)\,\sin\left( \theta \right)}{p^{4}} + \frac{\alpha\beta\mathit{\epsilon}\sin\left( \theta \right)}{p^{2}} + \theta} \\
  {- \frac{\frac{1}{2}\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}}{p^{3}} + \frac{\alpha\beta\mathit{\epsilon}\cos\left( \theta \right)}{p} + p} \\
  \end{pmatrix}$$

  The inverse transformation is

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (C-inv alpha beta epsilon order) (C
  alpha beta (- epsilon) order)) {% endhighlight %}

  With these components, the perturbative solution (equation
  [[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.9][7.9]]) is

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (((solution epsilon order) alpha beta)
  delta-t) (compose (C alpha beta epsilon order) ((solution0 alpha beta)
  delta-t) (C-inv alpha beta epsilon order))) {% endhighlight %}

  The resulting procedure maps an initial state to the solution state
  advanced by delta-t.

  We can examine the behavior of the perturbative solution and compare
  it to the true behavior of the pendulum. There are several
  considerations. We have truncated the Lie series for the phase-space
  transformation. Does the missing part matter? If the missing part does
  not matter, how well does this perturbation step work?

  [[#Fig_7-1][Figure 7.1]] shows that as we increase the number of terms
  in the Lie series for the phase-space coordinate transformation the
  result appears to converge. The lone trajectory includes only terms of
  first order. The others, including terms of second, third, and fourth
  order, are closely clustered. On the left edge of the graph (at /θ/ =
  −/π/), the order of the solution increases from the top to the bottom
  of the graph. In the middle (at /θ/ = 0), the fourth-order curve is
  between the second-order curve and the third-order curve. In addition
  to the error in phase-space path, there is also an error in the
  period---the higher-order orbits have longer periods <<p465>>than the
  first-order orbit. The parameters are /α/ = 1.0 and /β/ = 0.1. We have
  set /ϵ/ = 1. Each trajectory was started at /θ/ = 0 with /p/ = 0.7.
  Notice that the initial point on the solution varies between
  trajectories. This is because the transformation is not perfectly
  inverted by the truncated Lie series.

  #+caption: *Figure 7.1* The perturbative solution in the phase plane,
  including terms of first, second, third, and fourth order in the
  phase-space coordinate transformation. The solutions appear to
  converge.
  [[file:images/Art_P1187.jpg]]

  [[#Fig_7-2][Figure 7.2]] compares the perturbative solution (with
  terms up to fourth order) with the actual trajectory of the pendulum.
  The initial points coincide, to the precision of the graph, because
  the terms to fourth order are sufficient. The trajectories deviate
  both in the phase plane and in the period, but they are still quite
  close.

  The trajectories of [[#Fig_7-1][figures 7.1]] and [[#Fig_7-2][7.2]]
  are all for the same initial state. As we vary the initial state we
  find that for trajectories in the circulation region, far from the
  separatrix, the perturbative solution does quite well. However, if we
  get close to the separatrix or if we enter the oscillation region, the
  perturbative solution is nothing like the real solution, and it does
  not even seem to converge. [[#Fig_7-3][Figure 7.3]] shows what happens
  when we try to use the perturbative solution inside the oscillation
  region. Each trajectory was started at /θ/ = 0 with /p/ = 0.55. The
  parameters are /α/ = 1.0 and /β/ = 0.1, as before.

  <<p466>>

  #+caption: *Figure 7.2* The perturbative solution in the phase plane,
  including terms of fourth order in the phase-space coordinate
  transformation, is compared with the actual trajectory. The actual
  trajectory is the lower of the two curves. The parameters are the same
  as in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-1][figure 7.1]].
  [[file:images/Art_P1188.jpg]]

  This failure of the perturbation solution should not be surprising. We
  assumed that the real motion was a distorted version of the motion of
  the free rotor. But in the oscillation region the assumption is not
  true---the pendulum is not rotating at all. The perturbative solutions
  can be valid (if they work at all!) only in a region where the
  topology of the real orbits is the same as the topology of the
  perturbative solutions.

  We can make a crude estimate of the range of validity of the
  perturbative solution by looking at the first correction term in the
  phase-space transformation ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.18][7.18]]).
  The correction in /θ/ is proportional to /ϵαβ//(/p/′)^{2}. This is not
  a small perturbation if

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\left| p\prime \right| < \sqrt{\mathit{\epsilon}\alpha\beta}.} & \left( 7.22 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  This sets the scale for the validity of the perturbative solution.

  We can compare this scale to the size of the oscillation region (see
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-4][figure 7.4]]). We can obtain the width
  of the region of oscillation of the pendulum^{[[#endnote_1][1]]} by
  considering the separatrix. The value <<p467>>of the Hamiltonian on
  the separatrix is the same as the value at the unstable equilibrium:
  /H/(/t/, /θ/ = /π/, /p/ = 0) = /βϵ/. The separatrix has maximum
  momentum /p/^{sep} at /θ/ = 0:

  #+caption: *Figure 7.3* The perturbative solution does not converge in
  the oscillation region. As we include more terms in the Lie series for
  the phase-space transformation, the resulting trajectory develops
  loops near the hyperbolic fixed point that increase in size with the
  order.
  [[file:images/Art_P1189.jpg]]

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H\left( {t,0,p^{\text{sep}}} \right) = H\left( {t,\pi,0} \right).} & \left( 7.23 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Solving for /p/^{sep}, the half-width of the region of oscillation, we
  find

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {p^{\text{sep}} = 2\sqrt{\alpha\beta\mathit{\epsilon}}.} & \left( 7.24 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Comparing equations ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.22][7.22]]) and
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.24][7.24]]), we see that the
  requirement that the terms in the perturbation solution be small
  excludes a region of the phase space with the same scale as the region
  of oscillation of the pendulum.

  What the perturbation theory is doing is deforming the phase-space
  coordinate system so that the problem looks like the free-rotor
  problem. This deformation is sensible only in the circulating case.
  So, it is not surprising that the perturbation theory fails in the
  oscillation region. What may be surprising is how well the
  perturbation theory works just outside the oscillation region. The
  <<p468>>range of /p/ in which the perturbation theory is not valid
  scales in the same way as the width of the oscillation region. This
  need not have been the case---the perturbation theory could have
  failed over a wider range.

  #+caption: *Figure 7.4* The oscillation region of the pendulum is
  delimited by the separatrix. The maximum momentum occurs at the
  zero-crossing of the angle. Energy is conserved, so the energy is the
  same at the point of maximum momentum and at the unstable fixed point.
  At the unstable fixed point the energy is entirely potential energy,
  because the momentum is zero. We use this to compute the maximum
  momentum (where the potential energy is zero and all of the energy is
  kinetic).

  We can improve the perturbative solution by carrying out additional
  perturbation steps. The overall plan is the same as before. We perform
  a Lie transformation with a new generator that eliminates the desired
  terms from the Hamiltonian.

  After the first step the Hamiltonian is, to second order in /ϵ/,

   & {= \frac{\left( p\prime \right)^{2}}{2\alpha} + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\frac{\alpha\beta^{2}}{4\left( p\prime \right)^{2}}\left( {1 - \cos\left( {2\theta\prime} \right)} \right) + \cdots} & \\
   & {= H_{0}\left( p\prime \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}H_{2}\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.25 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  Performing a Lie transformation with generator /W/′ yields the
  Hamiltonian

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H''} & {= e^{\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W\prime}}H\prime} & \\
   & {= H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\left( {L_{W\prime}H_{0} + H_{2}} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.26 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  So the condition on /W/′ that the second-order terms are eliminated is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {L_{W\prime}H_{0} + H_{2} = 0.} & \left( 7.27 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  This is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {- \frac{p\prime}{\alpha}\partial_{1}W\prime\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) + \frac{\alpha\beta^{2}}{4\left( p\prime \right)^{2}}\left( {1 - \cos\left( {2\theta\prime} \right)} \right) = 0.} & \left( 7.28 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  A generator that satisfies this condition is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W\prime\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) = \frac{\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}}{4\left( p\prime \right)^{3}}{\theta\prime} + \frac{\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}}{8\left( p\prime \right)^{3}}\sin\left( {2\theta\prime} \right).} & \left( 7.29 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  There are two contributions to this generator, one proportional to
  /θ/′ and the other involving a trigonometric function of /θ/′.

  The phase-space coordinate transformation resulting from this Lie
  transform is found as before. For given initial conditions, we first
  carry out the inverse transformation corresponding to /W/, then that
  for /W/′, solve for the evolution of the system using /H/_{0}, then
  transform back using /W/′ and then /W/. For initial state /s/_{0} =
  (/t/_{0}, /θ/_{0}, /p/_{0}) and advanced state /s/ = (/t, θ/, /p/),
  the approximate solution is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  \begin{array}{lll}
  s & {= \left( {E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}E_{- \mathit{\epsilon}^{2},W\prime}^{\prime}E_{{({t - t_{0}})},H_{0}}E_{\mathit{\epsilon}^{2},W\prime}^{\prime}E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I} \right)\left( s_{0} \right)} & \\
   & {= \left( {e^{- \mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}e^{- \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W\prime}}e^{{({t - t_{0}})}D_{H_{0}}}e^{\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W\prime}}e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}I} \right)\left( s_{0} \right).} & \left( 7.30 \right) \\
  \end{array} & \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  #+caption: *Figure 7.5* The solution using a second perturbation step,
  eliminating /ϵ/^{2} terms from the Hamiltonian, is compared to the
  actual solution. The initial agreement is especially good, but the
  error increases with time.
  [[file:images/Art_P1191.jpg]]

  The solution obtained in this way is compared to the actual evolution
  of the pendulum in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-5][figure 7.5]]. Terms
  in all Lie series up to /ϵ/^{4} are included. The perturbative
  solution, including this second perturbative step, is much closer to
  the actual solution in the initial segment than the first-order
  perturbative solution ([[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-2][figure 7.2]]).
  The time interval spanned is 10. Over longer times the second-order
  perturbative solution diverges dramatically from the actual solution,
  as shown in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-6][figure 7.6]]. These
  solutions begin at /θ/ = 0 with /p/ = 0.7. The parameters are /α/ =
  1.0 and /β/ = 0.1. The time interval spanned is 100.

  A problem with the perturbative solution is that there are terms in
  /W/′ and in the corresponding phase-space coordinate transformation
  that are proportional to /θ/′, and /θ/′ grows linearly with time. So
  the solution can be valid only for small times; the interval of
  validity depends on the frequency of the particular trajectory under
  investigation and the size of the coefficients multiplying the various
  terms. Such terms in a perturbative representation of the solution
  that are proportional to time are called /secular terms/. They limit
  the validity of the perturbation theory to small times.

  <<p471>>

  plane; this perturbative solution wanders all over the place and gets

  *** *7.2.2 Eliminating Secular Terms*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_7-2-2
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  A solution to the problem of secular terms was developed by Lindstedt
  and Poincaré. The goal of each perturbation step is to eliminate terms
  in the Hamiltonian that prevent solution. However, the term in /H/′
  that led to the secular term in the generator /W/′ does not actually
  impede solution. So a better procedure is to leave that term in the
  Hamiltonian and find the generator /W/″ that eliminates only the term
  that is periodic in /θ/′. So /W/″ must satisfy

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {- \frac{p\prime}{\alpha}\partial_{1}W''\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) - \frac{\alpha\beta^{2}}{4\left( p\prime \right)^{2}}\cos\left( {2\theta\prime} \right) = 0.} & \left( 7.31 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  The generator is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W''\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) = \frac{\alpha^{2}\beta^{2}}{8\left( p\prime \right)^{3}}\sin\left( {2\theta\prime} \right).} & \left( 7.32 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  <<p472>>

  After we perform a Lie transformation with this generator, the new
  Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H''\left( {t,\theta'',p''} \right) = \frac{\left( p'' \right)^{2}}{2\alpha} + \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\frac{\alpha\beta^{2}}{4\left( p'' \right)^{2}} + \cdots.} & \left( 7.33 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Including terms up to the /ϵ/^{2} term, the solution is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\theta''} & {= \theta_{0}^{''} + \left( {\frac{p_{0}^{''}}{\alpha} - \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}\frac{\alpha\beta^{2}}{2\left( p_{0}^{''} \right)^{3}}} \right)\left( {t - t_{0}} \right)} & \\
  {p''} & {= p_{0}^{''}.} & \left( 7.34 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  We construct the solution for a given initial condition as before by
  composing the transformations, the solution of the modified
  Hamiltonian, and the inverse transformations. The approximate solution
  is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  \left( {t,\theta,p} \right) & {= \left( {E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}E_{- \mathit{\epsilon}^{2},W''}^{''}E_{{({t - t_{0}})},H''}E_{\mathit{\epsilon}^{2},W''}^{\prime}E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I} \right)\left( {t_{0},\theta_{0},p_{0}} \right)} & \\
   & {= \left( {e^{- \mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}e^{- \mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W''}}e^{{({t - t_{0}})}D_{H''}}e^{\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}L_{W''}}e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}I} \right)\left( {t_{0},\theta_{0},p_{0}} \right).} & \left( 7.35 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  The resulting phase-space evolution is shown in
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-7][figure 7.7]]. Now the perturbative
  solution is a closed curve in the phase plane and is in pretty good
  agreement with the actual solution.

  By modifying the solvable part of the Hamiltonian we are modifying the
  frequency of the solution. The secular terms appeared because we were
  trying to approximate a solution with one frequency as a Fourier
  series with the wrong frequency. As an analogy, consider

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\sin\left( {\omega + \Delta\omega} \right)t} & {= \sin\omega t\cos\Delta\omega t + \cos\omega t\sin\Delta\omega t} & \\
   & {= \sin\omega t\left( {1 - \frac{\left( {\Delta\omega t} \right)^{2}}{2} + \cdots} \right)} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\, + \cos\omega t\,\left( {\Delta\omega t + \cdots} \right).} & \left( 7.36 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  The periodic terms are multiplied by terms that are polynomials in the
  time. These polynomials are the initial segment of the power series
  for periodic functions. The infinite series are convergent, but if the
  series are truncated the error is large at large times.

  Continuing the perturbative solution to higher orders is now a
  straightforward repetition of the steps carried out so far. At each
  step in the perturbation solution there will be new contributions to
  <<p473>>the solvable part of the Hamiltonian that absorb potential
  secular terms. The contribution is just the angle-independent part of
  the Hamiltonian after the Hamiltonian is written as a Fourier series.
  The constant part of the Fourier series is the same as the average of
  the Hamiltonian over the angle. So at each step in the perturbation
  theory, the average of the perturbation is included with the solvable
  part of the Hamiltonian and the periodic part is eliminated by a Lie
  transformation.

  #+caption: *Figure 7.7* The two-step perturbative solution without
  secular terms is compared to the actual solution. The perturbative
  solution is now a closed curve and is very close to the actual
  solution.

  * *7.3 Many Degrees of Freedom*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h1-43
    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  Other problems are encountered in applying perturbation theory to
  systems with more than a single degree of freedom. Consider an /n/
  degrees-of-freedom Hamiltonian of the form

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H = H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1},} & \left( 7.37 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /H/_{0} depends only on the momenta and therefore is solvable.
  We assume that the Hamiltonian has no explicit time dependence.
  <<p474>>We further assume that the coordinates are all angles and that
  /H/_{1} is a multiply periodic function of the coordinates.

  Carrying out a Lie transformation with generator /W/ produces the
  Hamiltonian

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H\prime} & {= e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}H} & \\
   & {= H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}\left( {L_{W}H_{0} + H_{1}} \right) + \cdots,} & \left( 7.38 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  as before. The condition that the order /ϵ/ terms are eliminated is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\left\{ {H_{0},W} \right\} + H_{1} = 0,} & \left( 7.39 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  a linear partial differential equation. By assumption, the Hamiltonian
  /H/_{0} depends only on the momenta. We define

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\omega_{0}\left( p \right) = \partial_{2}H_{0}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right),} & \left( 7.40 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /θ/ = (/θ/^{0}, ..., /θ/^{/n/−1}), and /p/ = [/p/_{0}, ...,
  /p/_{/n/−1}]. So /ω/_{0}(/p/) is the up tuple of frequencies of the
  unperturbed system. The condition on /W/ is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {w_{0}\left( p \right)\partial_{1}W\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = H_{1}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right).} & \left( 7.41 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  As /H/_{1} is a multiply periodic function of the coordinates, we can
  write it as a Poisson series:^{[[#endnote_2][2]]}

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{1}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k}{A_{k}\left( p \right)\,\cos\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right),}}} & \left( 7.42 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /k/ = [/k/_{0}, ..., /k/_{/n/−1}] ranges over all /n/-tuples of
  integers. Similarly, we assume /W/ can be written as a Poisson series:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k}{B_{k}\left( p \right)\,\sin\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right).}}} & \left( 7.43 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Substituting these into the condition that order /ϵ/ terms are
  eliminated, we find

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\sum\limits_{k}{B_{k}\left( p \right)\left( {k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p \right)} \right)\,\cos\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k}{A_{k}\left( p \right)\,\cos\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right).}}}} & \left( 7.44 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  <<p475>>

  The cosines are orthogonal so the coefficients of corresponding cosine
  terms must be equal:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {B_{k}\left( p \right) = \frac{A_{k}\left( p \right)}{k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p \right)}} & \left( 7.45 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  and that the required Lie generator is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k}{\frac{A_{k}\left( p \right)}{k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p \right)}\sin\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right).}}} & \left( 7.46 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  There are a couple of problems. First, if /A/_{0,...,0} is nonzero
  then the expression for /B/_{0,...,0} involves a division by zero. So
  the expression for /B/_{0,...,0} is not correct. The problem is that
  the corresponding term in /H/_{1} does not involve /θ/. So the
  integration for /B/_{0,...,0} should introduce linear terms in /θ/.
  But this is the same situation that led to the secular terms in the
  perturbation approximation to the pendulum. Having learned our lesson
  there, we avoid the secular terms by adjoining this term to the
  solvable Hamiltonian and excluding /k/ = [0, ..., 0] from the sum for
  /W/. We have

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H\prime = H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}A_{0,\ldots,0} + \cdots,} & \left( 7.47 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  and

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k \neq {\lbrack{0,\ldots,0}\rbrack}}{\frac{A_{k}\left( p \right)}{k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p \right)}\sin\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right).}}} & \left( 7.48 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Another problem is that there are many opportunities for small
  denominators that would make the perturbation large and therefore not
  a perturbation. As we saw in the perturbation approximation for the
  pendulum in terms of the rotor, we must exclude certain regions from
  the domain of applicability of the perturbation approximation. These
  excluded regions are associated with commensurabilities among the
  frequencies /ω/_{0}(/p/). Consider the phase-space transformation of
  the coordinates

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  \theta & {= \left( {e^{\mathit{\epsilon}L_{W}}Q} \right)\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right)} & \\
   & {= \theta\prime + \mathit{\epsilon}\partial_{2}W\left( {t,\theta\prime,p\prime} \right) + \cdots} & \\
   & {= \theta\prime + \mathit{\epsilon}{\sum\limits_{k \neq {\lbrack{0,\ldots,0}\rbrack}}\left( {\frac{DA_{k}\left( p\prime \right)}{k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p\prime \right)} - \frac{A_{k}\left( p\prime \right)\left( {k \cdot D\omega\left( p\prime \right)} \right)}{\left( {k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p\prime \right)} \right)^{2}}} \right)}\sin\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right).} & \left( 7.49 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  <<p476>>

  We must exclude from the domain of applicability all regions for which
  the coefficients are large. If the second term in the coefficient of
  sin dominates, the excluded regions satisfy

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\left| {{({k \cdot D\omega{(p\prime)}})}A_{k}{(p)}} \right| > {({k \cdot \omega_{0}{(p)}})}^{2}.} & {(7.50)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Considering the fact that for any tuple of frequencies /ω/_{0}(/p/′)
  we can find a tuple of integers /k/ such that /k/·/ω/(/p/′) is
  arbitrarily small, this problem of small divisors looks very serious.

  However, the problem, though serious, is not as bad as it may appear,
  for a couple of reasons. First, it may be that /A_{k}/ ≠ 0 only for
  certain /k/. In this case, only the regions for these terms are
  excluded from the domain of applicability. Second, for analytic
  functions the magnitude of /A_{k}/ decreases strongly with the size of
  /k/ (see [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_4][4]]]):

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\left| {A_{k}\left( p\prime \right)} \right| \leq Ce^{- \beta{|k|}_{+}},} & \left( 7.51 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  for some positive /β/ and /C/, and where |/k/|_{+} = |/k/_{0}| +
  |/k/_{1}| + ⋯. At any stage of a perturbation approximation we can
  limit consideration to just those terms that are larger than a
  specified magnitude. The size of the excluded region corresponding to
  a term is of order square root of |/A_{k}/(/p/′)| and the inequality
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.51][7.51]]) shows that |/A_{k}/(/p/′)|
  decreases exponentially with the order of the term.

  *** *7.3.1 Driven Pendulum as a Perturbed Rotor*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_7-3-1
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  More concretely, consider the periodically driven pendulum. We will
  develop approximate solutions for the driven pendulum as a perturbed
  rotor.

  We use the Hamiltonian

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = \frac{p^{2}}{2ml^{2}} - \mathit{\epsilon}ml{({g - A\omega^{2}\cos{({\omega t})}})}\,\cos\theta.} & \left( 7.52 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  For a real driven pendulum /ϵ/ = 1; here it is used to help organize
  the computation. We will see that it need not be small and can be set
  to 1 at the end. We can remove the explicit time dependence by going
  to the extended phase space. The Hamiltonian is

  <<p477>>

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {H{({\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}})}} & \\
  {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = p_{t} + \frac{p^{2}}{2ml^{2}} - \mathit{\epsilon}ml{({g - A\omega^{2}\cos{({\omega t})}})}\,\cos\theta} & \\
  {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = p_{t} + \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} - \mathit{\epsilon}\beta\cos{(\theta)} + \mathit{\epsilon}\gamma\cos{({\theta + \omega t})} + \mathit{\epsilon}\gamma\cos{({\theta - \omega t})},} & {(7.53)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  with the constants /α/ = /ml/^{2}, /β/ = /mlg/, and

  $\gamma = \frac{1}{2}mlA\omega^{2}$

  .

  With the intent to approximate the driven pendulum as a perturbed
  rotor, we choose

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H_{0}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & {= p_{t} + \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha}} & \\
  {H_{1}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & {= - \beta\cos\theta + \gamma\cos\left( {\theta + \omega t} \right) + \gamma\cos\left( {\theta - \omega t} \right).} & \left( 7.54 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  The perturbation /H/_{1} is particularly simple: it has only three
  terms, and the coefficients are constants. Because /H/_{1} has only
  three terms in its Poisson series, only three regions will be excluded
  from the domain of applicability in the first perturbation step.

  The Lie series generator that eliminates the terms in /H/_{1} to first
  order in /ϵ/, satisfying

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\left\{ {H_{0},W} \right\} + H_{1} = 0,} & \left( 7.55 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {W\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & {= - \frac{\beta}{\omega_{r}\left( p \right)}\sin\theta} & \\
   & {+ \frac{\gamma}{\omega_{r}\left( p \right) + \omega}\sin\left( {\theta + \omega t} \right)} & \\
   & {+ \frac{\gamma}{\omega_{r}\left( p \right) - \omega}\sin\left( {\theta - \omega t} \right),} & \left( 7.56 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  where /ω_{r}/(/p/) = ∂_{2,0}/H/_{0}(/τ/; /θ/, /t/; /p/, /p_{t}/) =
  /p///α/ is the unperturbed rotor frequency.

  The resulting approximate solution has three regions in which there
  are small denominators, and so three regions that are excluded from
  applicability of the perturbative solution. Regions of phase space for
  which /ω_{r}/(/p/) is near 0, /ω/, and −/ω/ are excluded. Away from
  these regions the perturbative solution works well, <<p478>>just as in
  the rotor approximation for the pendulum. Unfortunately, some of the
  more interesting regions of the phase space of the driven pendulum are
  excluded: the region in which we find the remnant of the undriven
  pendulum is excluded, as are the two resonance regions in which the
  rotation of the pendulum is synchronous with the drive. We need to
  develop methods for approximating these regions.

  * *7.4 Nonlinear Resonance*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h1-44
    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  We can develop an approximation for an isolated resonance region as
  follows. We again consider Hamiltonians of the form

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H = H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1},} & \left( 7.57 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /H/_{0}(/t/, /q/, /p/) = /Ĥ/_{0}(/p/) depends only on the
  momenta and so is solvable. We assume that the Hamiltonian has no
  explicit time dependence. We further assume that the coordinates are
  all angles, and that /H/_{1} is a multiply periodic function of the
  coordinates that can be written

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{1}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k}{A_{k}\left( p \right)\,\cos\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right).}}} & \left( 7.58 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Suppose we are interested in a region of phase space for which /n/ ·
  /ω/_{0}(/p/) is near zero, where /n/ is a tuple of integers, one for
  each degree of freedom. If we develop the perturbation theory as
  before with the generator /W/ that eliminates all terms of order /ϵ/,
  then the transformed Hamiltonian is /H/_{0}, which is analytically
  solvable, but there would be terms with /n/ · /ω/_{0}(/p/) in the
  denominator. The resulting solution is not applicable near this
  resonance.

  Just as the problem of secular terms was solved by grouping more terms
  with the solvable part of the Hamiltonian, we can develop
  approximations that are valid in the resonance region by eliminating
  fewer terms and grouping more terms in the solvable part.

  To develop a perturbative approximation in the resonance region for
  which /n/ · /ω/_{0}(/p/) is near zero, we take the generator /W/ to be

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W_{n}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\sum\limits_{k \neq 0,k \neq n}{\frac{A_{k}\left( p \right)}{k \cdot \omega_{0}\left( p \right)}\sin\left( {k \cdot \theta} \right),}}} & \left( 7.59 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  <<p479>>

  excluding terms in /W/ that lead to small denominators in this region.
  The transformed Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{n}^{\prime}\left( {t,\theta,p} \right) = {\widehat{H}}_{0}\left( p \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}A_{0}\left( p \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}A_{n}\left( p \right)\,\cos\left( {n \cdot \theta} \right) + \cdots,} & \left( 7.60 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where the additional terms are higher-order in /ϵ/. Because the term
  /k/ = /n/ is excluded from the sum in the generating function, that
  term is left after the transformation.

  The transformed Hamiltonian depends only on a single combination of
  angles, so a change of variables can be made so that the new
  transformed Hamiltonian is cyclic in all but one coordinate, which is
  this combination of angles. This transformed Hamiltonian is solvable
  (reducible to quadratures).

  For example, suppose there are two degrees of freedom /θ/ = (/θ/_{1},
  /θ/_{2}) and we are interested in a region of phase space in which /n/
  · /ω/_{0} is near zero, with /n/ = [/n/_{1}, /n/_{2}]. The combination
  of angles /n/ · /θ/ is slowly varying in the resonance region. The
  transformed Hamiltonian ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.60][7.60]]) is
  of the form

  We can transform variables to /σ/ = /n/_{1}/θ/_{1} + /n/_{2}/θ/_{2},
  with second coordinate, say, /θ/′ = /θ/_{2}.^{[[#endnote_3][3]]} Using
  the /F/_{2}-type generating function

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {F_{2}\left( {t;\theta_{1},\theta_{2};\Sigma,\Theta\prime} \right) = \left( {n_{1}\theta_{1} + n_{2}\theta_{2}} \right)\Sigma + \theta_{2}\Theta\prime,} & \left( 7.62 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  we find that the transformation is

  $$\begin{array}{rll}
  p_{1} & {= n_{1}\Sigma} & \\
  p_{2} & {= n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} & \\
  \sigma & {= n_{1}\theta_{1} + n_{2}\theta_{2}} & \\
  {\theta\prime} & {= \theta_{2}.} & \left( 7.63 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  In these variables the transformed resonance Hamiltonian

  $H_{n}^{\prime}$

  becomes

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H_{n}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma,\Theta\prime} \right)} & {= {\widehat{H}}_{0}\left( {n_{1}\Sigma,n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}A_{0}\left( {n_{1}\Sigma,n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} \right)} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\,\, + \mathit{\epsilon}A_{n}\left( {n_{1}\Sigma,n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} \right)\,\cos\left( \sigma \right).} & \left( 7.64 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  <<p480>>

  This Hamiltonian is cyclic in /θ/′, so Θ′ is constant. With this
  constant momentum, the Hamiltonian for the conjugate pair (/σ/, Σ) has
  one degree of freedom. The solutions are level curves of the
  Hamiltonian. These solutions, reexpressed in terms of the original
  phase-space coordinates, give the evolution of

  $H_{n}^{\prime}$

  . An approximate solution in the resonance region is therefore

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {{({t,\theta,p})} = {({E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W_{n}^{\prime}}^{\prime}E_{t - t_{0},H_{n}^{\prime}}E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W_{n}^{\prime}}^{\prime}I})}{({t_{0},\theta_{0},p_{0}})}.} & {(7.65)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  If the resonance regions are sufficiently separated, then a global
  solution can be constructed by splicing together such solutions for
  each resonance region.

      :END:
  The resonance Hamiltonian ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.64][7.64]])
  has a single degree of freedom and is therefore solvable (reducible to
  quadratures). We can develop an approximate analytic solution in the
  vicinity of the resonance by making use of the fact that the solution
  is valid there. The resonance Hamiltonian can be approximated by a
  generalized pendulum Hamiltonian.

  Let

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma,\Theta\prime} \right)} & \\
  {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\widehat{H}}_{0}\left( {n_{1}\Sigma,n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} \right) + \mathit{\epsilon}A_{0}\left( {n_{1}\Sigma,n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} \right)} & \left( 7.66 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  and

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{n,1}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma,\Theta\prime} \right) = A_{n}\left( {n_{1}\Sigma,n_{2}\Sigma + \Theta\prime} \right)\,\cos\left( \sigma \right);} & \left( 7.67 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  then the resonance Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{n}^{''} = H_{n,0}^{''} + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{n,1}^{''}.} & \left( 7.68 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Define the resonance center Σ/_{n}/ by the requirement that the
  resonance frequency be zero there:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\partial_{2,0}H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right) = 0.} & \left( 7.69 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Now expand both parts of the resonance Hamiltonian about the resonance
  center:

  <<p481>>

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma,\Theta\prime} \right)} & {= H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right)} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{+ \partial_{2,0}H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right)\left( {\Sigma - \Sigma_{n}} \right)}} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{+ \frac{1}{2}\partial_{2,0}^{2}H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right)\left( {\Sigma - \Sigma_{n}} \right)^{2}}} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{+ \cdots,}} & \left( 7.70 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  and

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{n,1}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma,\Theta\prime} \right) = H_{n,1}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.71 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  The first term in the expansion of

  $H_{n,0}^{''}$

  is a constant and can be ignored. The coefficient of the second term
  is zero, from the definition of Σ/_{n}/. The third term is the first
  significant term. We presume here that the first term of

  $H_{n,1}^{''}$

  is a nonzero constant. Now the scale of the separatrix in Σ at
  resonance is typically proportional to

  $\sqrt{\mathit{\epsilon}}$

  . So the third term of

  $H_{n,0}^{''}$

  and the first term of

  $H_{n,1}^{''}$

  are both proportional to /ϵ/. Subsequent terms are higher-order in
  /ϵ/. Keeping only the order /ϵ/ terms, the approximate resonance
  Hamiltonian is of the form

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\frac{\left( {\Sigma - \Sigma_{n}} \right)^{2}}{2\alpha\prime} - \mathit{\epsilon}\beta\prime\cos\sigma,} & \left( 7.72 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  which is the Hamiltonian for a pendulum with a shifted center in
  momentum. This is analytically solvable. The constants are:

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\alpha\prime =} & {= {1/\left( {\partial_{2,0}^{2}H_{n,0}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right)} \right)}} & \\
  {\beta\prime =} & {= H_{n,1}^{''}\left( {t;\sigma,\theta\prime;\Sigma_{n},\Theta\prime} \right).} & \left( 7.73 \right) \\

  ** *Driven pendulum resonances*
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: driven-pendulum-resonances
     :CLASS: level2
     :END:
  Consider the behavior of the periodically driven pendulum in the
  vicinity of the resonance /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/.

  The Hamiltonian ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.54][7.54]]) for the
  driven pendulum has three resonance terms in /H/_{1}. The full
  generator ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.56][7.56]]) has three terms
  that are designed to eliminate the corresponding resonance terms in
  the Hamiltonian. The resulting approximate solution has small
  denominators close to each of the three resonances, /ω_{r}/(/p/) = 0,
  /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/, and /ω_{r}/(/p/) = −/ω/.

  To develop a resonance approximation near /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/, we do
  not include the corresponding term in the generator, so that the
  <<p482>>corresponding term is left in the Hamiltonian. It is helpful
  to give names to the various terms in the full generator
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.56][7.56]]):

  $$\begin{array}{rll}
  {W^{0}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & {= - \frac{\beta}{\omega_{r}\left( p \right)}\sin\theta} & \\
  {W^{-}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & {= \frac{\gamma}{\omega_{r}\left( p \right) + \omega}\sin\left( {\theta + \omega t} \right)} & \\
  {W^{+}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & {= \frac{\gamma}{\omega_{r}\left( p \right) - \omega}\sin\left( {\theta - \omega t} \right).} & \left( 7.74 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  The full generator is /W/^{0} + /W/^{−} + /W/^{+}.

  To investigate the motion in the phase space near the resonance
  /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/ (the “+” resonance), we use the generator that
  excludes the corresponding term

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {W_{+} = W^{0} + W^{-}.} & \left( 7.75 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  With this generator the transformed Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{+}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right) = p_{t} + \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} + \mathit{\epsilon}\gamma\cos\left( {\theta - \omega t} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.76 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  After we exclude the higher-order terms, this Hamiltonian has only a
  single combination of coordinates, and so can be transformed into a
  Hamiltonian that is cyclic in all but one degree of freedom. Define
  the transformation through the mixed-variable generating function

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {F_{2}\left( {\tau;t,\theta;\Sigma,p_{t}^{\prime}} \right) = \left( {\theta - \omega t} \right)\Sigma + tp_{t}^{\prime},} & \left( 7.77 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  giving the transformation

  $$\begin{array}{rll}
  \sigma & {= \theta - \omega t} & \\
  t & {= t\prime} & \\
  p & {= \Sigma} & \\
  p_{t} & {= p_{t}^{\prime} - \omega\Sigma.} & \left( 7.78 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  Expressed in these new coordinates, the resonance Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H_{+}\prime\left( {\tau;\sigma,t\prime;\Sigma,p_{t}^{\prime}} \right)} & {= p_{t}^{\prime} - \omega\Sigma + \frac{\Sigma^{2}}{2\alpha} + \mathit{\epsilon}\gamma\cos\sigma} & \\
   & {= \frac{\left( {\Sigma - \alpha\omega} \right)^{2}}{2\alpha} + \mathit{\epsilon}\gamma\cos\sigma + p_{t}^{\prime} - \frac{1}{2}\alpha\omega^{2}.} & \left( 7.79 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  [[file:images/Art_P1194.jpg]]

  This Hamiltonian is cyclic in /t/′, so the solutions are level curves
  of /H/_{+}′ in (/σ/, Σ). Actually, more can be said here because
  /H/_{+}′ is already of the form of a pendulum shifted in the Σ
  direction by /αω/ and shifted by /π/ in phase. The shift by /π/ comes
  about because the sign of the cosine term is positive, rather than
  negative as in the usual pendulum. A sketch of the level curves is
  given in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-8][figure 7.8]].

  *Exercise 7.2: Resonance width*

  Verify that the half-width of the resonance region is

  $2\sqrt{\alpha\gamma\mathit{\epsilon}}$

  .

  *Exercise 7.3: With the computer*

  Verify, with the computer, that with the generator /W/_{+} the
  transformed Hamiltonian is given by equation
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.76][7.76]]).

  An approximate solution of the driven pendulum near the /ω_{r}/(/p/) =
  /ω/ resonance is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {{({\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}})} = (E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W_{+}}^{\prime}E_{\tau - \tau_{0},H + \prime}E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W_{+}}^{\prime}I){({\tau_{0};\theta_{0},t_{0};p_{0},{(p_{t})}_{0}})}.} & {(7.80)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  To find out to what extent the approximate solution models the actual
  driven pendulum, we make a surface of section using this approximate
  solution and compare it to a surface of section for the <<p484>>actual
  driven pendulum. The surface of section for the approximate solution
  in the resonance region is shown in
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-9][figure 7.9]]. A surface of section for
  the actual driven pendulum is shown in the lower part of
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-10][figure 7.10]]. The correspondence is
  surprisingly good. Note how the resonance island is not symmetrical
  about a line of constant momentum. The resonance Hamiltonian is
  symmetrical about Σ = /αω/, and by itself would give a symmetric
  resonance island (see [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-8][figure 7.8]]).
  The necessary distortion is introduced by the /W/_{+} transformation
  that eliminates the other resonances. Indeed, in the full section the
  distortion appears to be generated by the nearby /ω_{r}/(/p/) = 0
  resonance “pushing away” nearby features so that it has room to fit.
  However, some features of the actual section are not represented in
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-9][figure 7.9]]: for instance, the small
  chaotic zone near the actual separatrix.

  #+caption: *Figure 7.9* Surface of section of the first-order
  perturbative solution for the driven pendulum constructed for the
  region near the resonance /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/. The parameters of the

  terms were kept in the Lie series for the /W/ transformation. The
  perturbative solution captures the essential shape and position of the
  resonant island it is designed to approximate.
  [[file:images/Art_P1195.jpg]]

  The distortion introduced by the transformation generated by /W/_{+}
  is small because the terms that it introduces are proportional to the
  inverse of a combination of frequencies.^{[[#endnote_4][4]]} Since
  this combination is not small, dividing by it makes the correction
  small. Thus the “order parameter” /ϵ/ need not be small to make the
  correction terms small, and from now on we can set /ϵ/ = 1.

  ±/ω/. A corresponding surface of section for the actual driven
  pendulum is shown below. The parameters of the system are: /α/ = 1,
  /β/ = 1, /γ/ = 1/4, and /ω/ = 5.
  [[file:images/Art_P1196.jpg]]

  The perturbation solution near the /ω_{r}/(/p/) = 0 resonance merges
  smoothly with the perturbation solutions for the /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/
  and /ω_{r}/(/p/) = −/ω/ resonances. We can make a composite
  perturbative solution by using the appropriate resonance solution for
  each region of phase space. A surface of section for the composite
  pertur-bative solution is shown in the upper part of
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-10][figure 7.10]], above the
  corresponding surface of section for the actual driven pendulum. The
  perturbative solution captures many features seen on the actual
  section. The shapes of the resonance regions are distorted by the
  transformations that eliminate the nearby resonances, so the resulting
  pieces fit together consistently. The predicted width of each
  resonance region agrees with the actual width: it is not substantially
  changed by the distortion of the region introduced by the elimination
  of the other resonance terms. But not all the features of the actual
  section are reproduced in this composite of first-order
  approximations. The first-order perturbative solution does not capture
  the resonant islands between the two primary resonances or the
  secondary island chains contained within a primary resonance region.
  Also, the first-order perturbative solution does not show the chaotic
  zone near the separatrix apparent in the surface of section for the
  actual driven pendulum.

  For larger drives, the approximations derived by first-order
  perturbations are worse. In the lower part of
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-11][figure 7.11]], with drive larger by a
  factor of five, we lose the invariant curves that separate the
  resonance regions. The main resonance islands persist, but the chaotic
  zones near the separatrices have merged into one large chaotic sea.

  The composite first-order perturbative solution for the more strongly
  driven pendulum in the upper part of
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-11][figure 7.11]] still approximates the
  centers of the main resonance islands reasonably well, but it fails as
  we move out and encounter the secondary islands that are visible in
  the resonance region for /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/. Here the approximations
  for the two regions do not fit together so well. The chaotic sea is
  found in the region where the perturbative solutions do not match.

  *** *7.4.2 Reading the Hamiltonian*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_7-4-2
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  The locations and widths of the primary resonance islands can often be
  read straight off the Hamiltonian when expressed as a Poisson series.
  For each term in the series for the perturbation there is a
  corresponding resonance island. The width of the island can often be
  simply computed from the coefficients in the Hamiltonian. So just by
  looking at the Hamiltonian we can get a good idea of what sort of
  behavior we will see on the surface of section. For instance, in the
  driven pendulum, the Hamiltonian
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.54][7.54]]) has three terms. We could
  anticipate, just from looking at the Hamiltonian, that three main
  resonance islands are to be found on the surface of section. We know
  that these islands will be located where the resonant combination of
  angles is slow. So for the periodically driven pendulum the resonances
  occur near /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/, /ω_{r}/(/p/) = 0, and /ω_{r}/(/p/) =
  −/ω/. The approximate widths of the resonance islands can be computed
  with a simple calculation.

  *** *7.4.3 Resonance-Overlap Criterion*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_7-4-3
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  As the size of the drive increases, the chaotic zones near the
  separatrices get larger and then merge into a large chaotic sea. The
  resonance-overlap criterion gives an analytic estimate of when this
  occurs. The basic idea is to compare the sum of the widths of
  neighboring resonances with their separation. If the sum of the
  half-widths is greater than the separation, then the resonance-overlap
  criterion predicts there will be large-scale chaotic behavior near the
  overlapping resonances. In the case of the periodically driven
  pendulum, the half-width of the /ω_{r}/(/p/) = 0 resonance is

  $2\sqrt{\alpha\beta}$

  and the half-width of the /ω_{r}/(/p/) = /ω/ resonance is

  $2\sqrt{\alpha\gamma}$

  (see [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-12][figure 7.12]]). The separation
  of the resonances is /αω/. So resonance overlap occurs if

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {2\sqrt{\alpha\beta} + 2\sqrt{\alpha\gamma} \geq \alpha\omega.} & \left( 7.81 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  The amplitude of the drive enters through /γ/. Solving, we find the
  value of /γ/ above which resonance overlap occurs. For the parameters
  /α/ = /β/ = 1, /ω/ = 5 used in [[#Fig_7-9][figures
  7.9]]--[[#Fig_7-11][7.11]], the resonance overlap value of /γ/ is 9/4.
  We see that, in fact, the chaotic zones have already merged for /γ/ =
  5/4. So in this case the resonance-overlap criterion overestimates the
  strength of the resonances required to get large-scale chaotic
  behavior. This is typical of the resonance-overlap criterion.

  <<p489>>

  #+caption: *Figure 7.12* Resonance overlap occurs when the sum of the
  half-widths of adjacent resonances is larger than the spacing between
  them.
  [[file:images/Art_P1198.jpg]]

  A way of thinking about why the resonance-overlap criterion usually
  overestimates the strength required to get large-scale chaos is that
  other effects must be taken into account. For instance, as the drive
  is increased second-order resonances appear between the primary
  resonances; these resonances take up space and so resonance overlap
  occurs for smaller drive than would be expected by considering the
  primary resonances alone. Also, the chaotic zones at each separatrix
  have area that must be accounted for.

  *** *7.4.4 Higher-Order Perturbation Theory*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_7-4-4
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  As the drive is increased, a variety of new islands emerge, which are
  not evident in the original Hamiltonian. To find approximations for
  motion in these regions we can use higher-order perturbation theory.
  The basic plan is the same as before. At any stage the Hamiltonian
  (which is perhaps a result of earlier stages of perturbation theory)
  is expressed as a Poisson series (a multiple-angle Fourier series).
  The terms that are not resonant in a region of interest are eliminated
  by a Lie transformation. The remaining resonance terms involve only a
  single combination of angle and are thus solvable by making a
  canonical transformation to resonance coordinates. We complete the
  solution and transform back to the original coordinates.

  <<p490>>

  Let's find a perturbative approximation for the second-order islands
  visible in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-10][figure 7.10]] between the
  /ω_{r}/(/p/) = 0 resonance and the /ω_{r}/(/p/) = −/ω/ resonance. The
  details are messy, so we will just give a few intermediate results.

  This resonance is not near the three primary resonances, so we can use
  the full generator ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.56][7.56]]) to
  eliminate those three primary resonance terms from the Hamiltonian.
  After this perturbation step the Hamiltonian is too hairy to look at.

  We expand the transformed Hamiltonian in Poisson form and divide the
  terms into those that are resonant and those that are not. The terms
  that are not resonant can be eliminated by a Lie transform. This Lie
  transform leaves the resonant terms in the Hamiltonian and introduces
  an additional distortion to the curves on the surface of section. In
  this case this additional distortion is small, but very messy to
  compute, so we will just not include this effect. The resonance
  Hamiltonian is then (after considerable algebra)

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {H_{2:1}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & \\
  {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} + p_{t} + \frac{\alpha\beta\gamma}{4p^{2}}\frac{\alpha^{2}\omega^{2} + 2\alpha\omega p + 2p^{2}}{\left( {\alpha\omega + p} \right)^{2}}\cos\left( {2\theta + \omega t} \right).} & \left( 7.82 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  This is solvable because there is only a single combination of
  coordinates.

  We can get an analytic solution by making the pendulum approximation.
  The Hamiltonian is already quadratic in the momentum /p/, so all we
  need to do is evaluate the coefficient of the potential terms at the
  resonance center /p/_{2:1} = /αω//2. The resonance Hamiltonian, in the
  pendulum approximation, is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{2:1}^{\prime}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right) = \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} + \frac{2\beta\gamma}{\alpha\omega^{2}}\cos\left( {2\theta + \omega t} \right).} & \left( 7.83 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Carrying out the transformation to the resonance variable /σ/ = 2/θ/ −
  /ωt/ reduces this to a pendulum Hamiltonian with a single degree of
  freedom. Combining the analytic solution of this pendulum Hamiltonian
  with the transformations generated by the full /W/, we get an
  approximate perturbative solution

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {{({\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}})} = {({E_{- \mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}E_{\tau - \tau_{0},H_{2:1}^{''}}E_{\mathit{\epsilon},W}^{\prime}I})}{({\tau_{0};\theta_{0},t_{0};p_{0},{(p_{t})}_{0}})}.} & {(7.84)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  <<p491>>

  approximation to the second-order islands near the resonance

  A surface of section in the appropriate resonance region using this
  solution is shown in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-13][figure 7.13]].
  Comparing this to the actual surface of section
  ([[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-10][figure 7.10]]), we see that the
  approximate solution provides a good representation of this resonance
  motion.

  As a second application, we use second-order perturbation theory to
  investigate the inverted vertical equilibrium of the periodically
  driven pendulum.

  Here, the procedure parallels the one just followed, but we focus on a
  different set of resonance terms. The terms that are slowly varying
  for the vertical equilibrium are those that involve /θ/ but do not
  involve /t/, such as cos(/θ/) and cos(2/θ/). So we want to use the
  generator /W/^{+} + /W/^{−} that eliminates the nonresonant terms
  involving combinations of /θ/ and /ωt/, while leaving the central
  resonance. After the Lie transform of the Hamiltonian with this
  generator, we write the transformed Hamiltonian as a Poisson
  <<p492>>series and collect the resonant terms. The transformed
  resonance Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {H_{V}^{\prime}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right)} & \\
  {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} - \beta\cos\theta + \frac{\alpha\gamma^{2}\left( {\alpha^{2}\omega^{2} + p^{2}} \right)}{2\left( {\alpha^{2}\omega^{2} - p^{2}} \right)^{2}}\cos\left( {2\theta} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.85 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  [[#Fig_7-14][Figure 7.14]] shows contours of this resonance
  Hamiltonian

  $H_{V}^{\prime}$

  (top) and a surface of section for the actual driven pendulum (bottom)
  for the same parameters. The behavior of the resonance Hamiltonian is
  indistinguishable from that of the actual driven pendulum. The theory
  does especially well here; there are no nearby resonances because the
  drive frequency is high.

  We can get an analytic estimate for the stability of the inverted
  vertical equilibrium by carrying out a linear stability analysis of
  the fixed point /θ/ = /π/, /p/ = 0 of the resonance Hamiltonian. The
  algebra is somewhat simpler if we first make the pendulum
  approximation about the resonance center. The resonance Hamiltonian is
  then approximately

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H_{V}^{''}\left( {\tau;\theta,t;p,p_{t}} \right) = \frac{p^{2}}{2\alpha} - \beta\cos\theta + \frac{\gamma^{2}}{2\alpha\omega^{2}}\cos\left( {2\theta} \right) + \cdots.} & \left( 7.86 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  Linear stability analysis of the inverted vertical equilibrium
  indicates stability for

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\gamma^{2} > \alpha\beta\omega^{2}.} & \left( 7.87 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  In terms of the original physical parameters, the vertical equilibrium
  is linearly stable if

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\frac{\omega}{\omega_{s}}\frac{A}{l} > \sqrt{2},} & \left( 7.88 \right) \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where

  $\omega_{s} = \sqrt{g/l}$

  , the small-amplitude oscillation frequency. For the vertical
  equilibrium to be stable, the scaled product of the amplitude of the
  drive and the drive frequency must be sufficiently large.

  This analytic estimate is compared with the behavior of the driven
  pendulum in [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-15][figure 7.15]]. For any
  given assignment of the parameters, the driven pendulum can be tested
  for the linear stability of the inverted vertical equilibrium by the
  methods of chapter 4; this involves determining the roots of the
  characteristic polynomial for a reference orbit at the resonance
  center. In the figure the stability of the inverted vertical
  equilibrium was assessed at each point of a grid of assignments of the
  parameters. A dot is shown for combinations of parameters that are
  linearly stable. The diagonal line is the analytic boundary of the
  region of stability of the inverted equilibrium:

  $\left( {\omega/\omega_{s}} \right)\left( {A/l} \right) = \sqrt{2}$

  . We see that the boundary of the region of stability is well
  approximated by the analytic estimate derived from perturbation
  theory. Note that for very high drive amplitudes there is another
  region of instability, which is not captured by this perturbation
  analysis.

  The goal of perturbation theory is to relate aspects of the motions of
  a given system to those of a nearby solvable system. Perturbation
  <<p495>>theory can be used to predict features such as the size and
  location of the resonance islands and chaotic zones.

  With perturbation analysis we obtain an approximation to the evolution
  of a system by relating the evolution of the system to that of a
  different system that, when approximated, can be exactly solved. We
  can carry this exact solution of the approximate problem back to the
  original system to obtain an approximate solution of our original
  problem. The strategy of canonical perturbation theory is to make
  canonical transformations that eliminate terms in the Hamiltonian that
  impede solution. Formulation of perturbation theory in terms of Lie
  series is especially convenient.

  We can use first-order perturbation theory to analyze the motion of
  the undriven pendulum as a free rotor to which gravity is added. In
  this analysis we find that a small denominator in the series limits
  the range of applicability of the perturbative solution to regions
  that are away from the resonant oscillation region.

  In higher-order perturbation theory for the pendulum we discover the
  problem of secular terms, terms that produce error that grow with
  time. The appearance of secular terms can be avoided by keeping track
  of how the frequencies change as perturbations are included. In
  canonical perturbation theory secular terms can be avoided by
  associating the average part of the perturbation with the solvable
  part of the Hamiltonian.

  In carrying out canonical perturbation theory in higher dimensions we
  find that the problem of small denominators is more serious. Small
  denominators arise near every commensurability, and commensurabilities
  are common. Small denominators can be locally avoided near particular
  commensurabilities by incorporating the offending terms into the
  solvable part of the Hamiltonian. If the resonances are isolated, the
  resulting resonance Hamiltonian is still solvable. In many cases the
  resonance Hamiltonian is well approximated by a pendulum-like
  Hamiltonian. A global picture can be constructed by stitching together
  the solutions for each resonance region constructed separately.

  If two resonance regions overlap---that is, if the sum of the
  half-widths of the resonance regions exceeds their separation---then
  large-scale chaos ensues. The chaotic regions associated with the
  separatrices of the overlapping resonances become connected. When the
  resonances are well approximated by pendulum-like resonances a simple
  analytic criterion for the appearance of large-scale chaos can be
  developed.

  <<p496>>

  Higher-order perturbative descriptions can be developed to describe
  islands that do not correspond to particular terms in the Hamiltonian,
  secondary resonances, bifurcations, and so on. The theory can be
  extended to describe as much detail as one wishes.

  *Exercise 7.4: Periodically driven pendulum*

  *a.* Work out the details of the perturbation theory for the primary
  driven pendulum resonances, as displayed in
  [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-10][figure 7.10]].

  *b.* Work out the details of the perturbation theory for the stability
  of the inverted vertical equilibrium. Derive the resonance Hamiltonian
  and plot its contours. Compare these contours to surfaces of section
  for a variety of parameters.

  *c.* Carry out the linear stability analysis leading to equation
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.88][7.88]]). What is happening in the
  upper part of [[file:chapter007.html#Fig_7-15][figure 7.15]]? Why is
  the system unstable when criterion
  ([[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.88][7.88]]) predicts stability? Use
  surfaces of section to investigate this parameter regime.

  *Exercise 7.5: Spin-orbit coupling*

  A Hamiltonian for the spin-orbit problem described in
  [[file:chapter002.html#h3_2-11-2][section 2.11.2]] is

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {H\left( {t,\theta,p_{\theta}} \right)} & {= \frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{2C} - \frac{n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}C}{4}\frac{a^{3}}{R^{3}\left( t \right)}\cos 2\left( {\theta - f\left( t \right)} \right)} & \\
   & {= \frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{2C} - \frac{n^{2}\mathit{\epsilon}^{2}C}{4}(\cos\left( {2\theta - 2nt} \right) + \frac{7e}{2}\cos\left( {2\theta - 3nt} \right)} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, - \frac{e}{2}\cos\left( {2\theta - nt} \right) + \cdots)} & \left( 7.89 \right) \\
  \end{array}$$

  where the ignored terms are higher order in eccentricity /e/. Note
  that here /ϵ/ is the out-of-roundness parameter.

  *a.* Find the widths and centers of the three primary resonances.
  Compare the predictions for the widths to the island widths seen on
  surfaces of section. Write the criterion for resonance overlap and
  compare to numerical experiments for the transition to large-scale
  chaos.

  *b.* The fixed point of the synchronous island is offset from the
  average rate of rotation. This is indicative of a “forced” oscillation
  of the rotation of the Moon. Develop a perturbative theory for motion
  in the synchronous island by using a Lie transform to eliminate the
  two non-synchronous resonances. Predict the location of the fixed
  point at the center of the synchronous resonance on the surface of
  section, and thus predict the amplitude of the forced oscillation of
  the Moon.

  [[#endnote_ref_1][^{1}]]The “width” is measured as the range of
  momenta.

  [[#endnote_ref_2][^{2}]]In general, we need to include sine terms as
  well, but the cosine expansion is enough for this illustration.

  [[#endnote_ref_3][^{3}]]Any linearly independent combination will be
  acceptable here.

  [[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.74][7.74]] and
  [[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.75][7.75]]; for the general relationship
  between a term in the generator and the coordinate transformation
  generated see equations [[file:chapter007.html#disp_7.48][7.48]] and
