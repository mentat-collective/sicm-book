  When we try to represent the figure formed by these two curves and
  their intersections in a finite number, each of which corresponds to a
  doubly asymptotic solution, these intersections form a type of
  trellis, tissue, or grid with infinitely serrated mesh. Neither of
  these two curves must ever cut across itself again, but it must bend
  back upon itself in a very complex manner in order to cut across all
  of the meshes in the grid an infinite number of times. The complexity
  of this figure will be striking, and I shall not even try to draw it.

  Henri Poincaré, /New Methods of Celestial Mechanics, volume III/
  [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_35][35]]], chapter XXXIII, section 397

  We have seen rather complicated features appear as part of the
  Poincaré sections of a variety of systems. We have seen fixed points,
  invariant curves, resonance islands, and chaotic zones in systems as
  diverse as the driven pendulum, the non-axisymmetric top, the
  Hénon--Heiles system, and the spin-orbit coupling of a satellite.
  Indeed, even in the standard map, where there is no continuous process
  sampled by the surface of section, the phase space shows similar
  features.

  The motion of other systems is simpler. For some systems conserved
  quantities can be used to reduce the solution to the evaluation of
  definite integrals. Such a system is traditionally called
  /integrable/. An example is the axisymmetric top. Two symmetries imply
  the existence of two conserved momenta, and time independence of the
  Hamiltonian implies energy conservation. With these conserved
  quantities, determining the motion is reduced to the evaluation of
  definite integrals of the periodic motion of the tilt angle as a
  function of time. Such systems do not exhibit chaotic behavior; on a
  surface of section the conserved quantities constrain the points to
  fall on curves. If points on a surface of section do not apparently
  fall on curves then we may take this as <<p286>>evidence that not
  enough conserved quantities exist to reduce the solution to
  quadratures.

  We have seen a number of instances in which the behavior of a system
  changes qualitatively with the inclusion of additional effects. The
  free rigid body can be reduced to quadratures, but the addition of
  gravity-gradient torques in the spin-orbit system yields the familiar
  mixture of regular and chaotic motions. The motion of an axisymmetric
  top is also reducible to quadratures, but if the top is made
  non-axisymmetric then the divided phase space appears. The system
  studied by Hénon and Heiles, with the classic divided phase space, can
  be thought of as a solvable pair of harmonic oscillators with
  nonlinear coupling terms. The pendulum is solvable, but the driven
  pendulum has the divided phase space.

  We observe that as additional effects are turned on, qualitative
  changes occur in the phase space. Resonance islands appear, chaotic
  zones appear, some invariant curves disappear, but others persist. Why
  do resonance islands appear? How does chaotic behavior arise? When do
  invariant curves persist? Can we draw any general conclusions?

  We can get some insight into these qualitative changes of behavior by
  considering systems in which the additional effects are turned on by
  varying a parameter. For some value of the parameter the system has
  enough conserved quantities to be reducible to quadratures; as we vary
  the parameter away from this value we can study how the divided phase
  space appears. The driven pendulum offers an archetypal example of
  such a system. If the amplitude of the drive is zero, then solutions
  of the driven pendulum are the same as the solutions of the undriven
  pendulum. We have seen surfaces of section for the strongly driven
  pendulum, illustrating the divided phase space. Here we crank up the
  drive slowly and study how the phase portrait changes.

  The motion of the driven pendulum with zero-amplitude drive is the
  same as that of an undriven pendulum, as described in
  [[file:chapter003.html#h1-17][section 3.3]]. Energy is conserved, so
  all orbits are level curves of the Hamiltonian in the phase plane (see
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-1][figure 4.1]]). There are three regions
  of the phase plane that have qualitatively different types <<p287>>of
  motion: the region in which the pendulum oscillates, the region in
  which the pendulum circulates in one direction, and the region of
  circulation in the other direction. In the center of the oscillation
  region there is a stable equilibrium, at which the pendulum is hanging
  motionless. At the boundaries between these regions the pendulum is
  asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium, at which the pendulum is
  standing upright. There are two asymptotic trajectories, corresponding
  to the two ways the equilibrium can be approached. Each of these is
  also asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium going backward in time.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.1* The phase plane of the undriven pendulum has
  three regions displaying two distinct kinds of behavior. Trajectories
  lie on the contours of the Hamiltonian. Trajectories may oscillate,
  making ovoid curves around the equilibrium point, or they may
  circulate, producing wavy tracks outside the eye-shaped region. The
  eye-shaped region is delimited by the separatrix. This pendulum has
  length 1 m and a bob of mass 1 kg, and the acceleration of gravity is
  9.8 m s^{−2}.

  ** *Driven pendulum sections with zero-amplitude drive*
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: driven-pendulum-sections-with-zero-amplitude-drive
     :CLASS: level2
     :END:
  Now consider the periodically driven pendulum, but with zero-amplitude
  drive. The state of the driven pendulum is specified by an angle
  coordinate, its conjugate momentum, and the phase of the periodic
  drive. With zero-amplitude drive the evolution of the “driven”
  pendulum is the same as the undriven pendulum. The <<p288>>phase of
  the drive does not affect the evolution, but we consider the phase of
  the drive as part of the state so we can give a uniform description
  that allows us to include the zero-amplitude drive case with the
  nonzero-amplitude case.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.2* A surface of section for the driven pendulum,
  with zero-amplitude drive. The effect is to sample the trajectories of
  the undriven pendulum, which lie on the contours of the Hamiltonian.
  Only a small number of points are plotted for each trajectory to
  illustrate the fact that for zero-amplitude drive the surface of
  section samples the continuous trajectories of the undriven pendulum.
  [[file:images/Art_P813.jpg]]

  For the driven pendulum we make stroboscopic surfaces of section by
  sampling the state at the drive period and plotting the angular
  momentum versus the angle (see [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-2][figure
  4.2]]). For zero-amplitude drive, the section points are confined to
  the curves traced by trajectories of the undriven pendulum. For each
  kind of orbit that we saw for the undriven pendulum, there are orbits
  of the driven pendulum that generate a corresponding pattern of points
  on the section.

  The two stationary orbits at the equilibrium points of the pendulum
  appear as points on the surface of section. Equilibrium points are
  fixed points of the Poincaré map.

  Section points for the oscillating orbits of the pendulum fall on the
  corresponding contour of the Hamiltonian. Section points for
  <<p289>>the circulating orbits of the pendulum are likewise confined
  to the corresponding contour of the Hamiltonian. We notice that the
  pattern of the points generated by orbits varies from contour to
  contour. Typically, if we collected more points on the surface of
  section the points would eventually fill in the contours. However,
  there are actually two possibilities. Remember that the period of the
  pendulum is different for different trajectories. If the period of the
  pendulum is commensurate with the period of the drive, then only a
  finite number of points will appear on the section. Two periods are
  commensurate if one is a rational multiple of the other. If the two
  periods are incommensurate then the section points never repeat. In
  fact, the points fill the contour densely, coming arbitrarily close to
  every point on the contour.

  Section points for the asymptotic trajectories of the pendulum fall on
  the contour of the Hamiltonian containing the saddle point. Each
  asymptotic orbit generates a sequence of isolated points that
  accumulate near the fixed point. No individual orbit fills the
  sep-aratrix on the section.

  ** *Driven pendulum sections for small drive*
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: driven-pendulum-sections-for-small-drive
     :CLASS: level2
     :END:
  Now consider the surface of section for small-amplitude drive (see
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-3][figure 4.3]]). The amplitude of the
  drive is /A/ = 0.001 m; the drive frequency is 4.2 /ω/_{0}, where

  $\omega_{0} = \sqrt{g/l}$

  . The overall appearance of the surface of section is similar to the
  section with zero-amplitude drive. Many orbits appear to lie on
  invariant curves similar to the invariant curves of the zero-drive
  case. However, there are several new features.

  There are now resonance regions that correspond to the pendulum
  rotating in lock with the drive. These features are found in the upper
  and lower circulating region of the surface of section. Each island
  has a fixed point for which the pendulum rotates exactly once per
  cycle of the drive. In general, fixed points on the surface of section
  correspond to periodic motions of the system in the full phase space.
  The fixed point is at ±/π/, indicating that the pendulum is vertical
  at the section phase of the drive. For orbits in the resonance region
  away from the fixed point the points on the section apparently
  generate curves that surround the fixed point.^{[[#endnote_1][1]]} For
  these orbits the pendulum rotates on average once per <<p290>>drive,
  but the phase of the pendulum is sometimes ahead of the drive and
  sometimes behind it.

  There are other islands that appear with nonzero-amplitude drive. In
  the central oscillation region there is a sixfold chain of secondary
  islands. For this orbit the pendulum is oscillating, and the period of
  the oscillation is commensurate with the drive. The six islands are
  all generated by a single orbit. In fact, the islands are visited
  successively in a clockwise direction. After six cycles of the drive
  the section point returns to the same island but falls at a different
  point on the island curve, accumulating the island curve after many
  iterations. The motion of the pendulum is not periodic, but is locked
  in a resonance so that on average it oscillates once for every six
  cycles of the drive.

  Another feature that appears is a narrow chaotic region near where the
  separatrix was in the zero-amplitude drive pendulum. We find that
  chaotic behavior typically makes its most prominent appearance near
  separatrices. This is not surprising because the difference in
  velocities that distinguish whether the pendulum rotates or oscillates
  is small for orbits near the separatrix. As the pendulum approaches
  the top, whether it receives the extra nudge it needs to go over the
  top depends on the phase of the drive.

  Actually, the apparent separatrices of the resonance islands for which
  the pendulum period is equal to the drive period are each generated by
  a chaotic orbit. To see that this orbit appears to occupy an area one
  would have to magnify the picture by about a factor of 10^{4}.

  As the drive amplitude is increased the main qualitative changes are
  the appearance of resonance islands and chaotic zones. Some
  qualitative characteristics of the zero-amplitude case remain. For
  instance, many orbits appear to lie on invariant curves. This behavior
  is not peculiar to the driven pendulum; similar features quite
  generally arise as additional effects are added to problems that are
  reducible to quadratures. This chapter is devoted to understanding in
  greater detail how these generic features arise.

  * *4.2 Linear Stability*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h1-24
    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  Qualitative changes are associated with fixed points of the surface of
  section. As the drive is turned on, chaotic zones appear at fixed
  points on separatrices of the undriven system, and we observe the
  <<p291>>appearance of new fixed points and periodic points associated
  with resonance islands. Here we investigate the behavior of systems
  near fixed points. We can distinguish two types of fixed points on a
  surface of section: there are fixed points that correspond to
  equilibria of the system and there are fixed points that correspond to
  periodic orbits of the system. We first consider the stability of
  equilibria of systems governed by differential equations, then discuss
  the stability of fixed points of maps.

  with nonzero drive amplitude /A/ = 0.001 m and drive frequency 4.2

  the zero-amplitude drive case. Here, in addition, some orbits belong
  to island chains and others are chaotic. The most apparent chaotic
  orbit is near the separatrix of the undriven pendulum.

  *** *4.2.1 Equilibria of Differential Equations*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_4-2-1
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  Consider first the case of an equilibrium of a system of differential
  equations. If a system is initially at an equilibrium point, the
  system remains there. What can we say about the evolution of the
  system for points near such an equilibrium point? This is actually a
  very difficult question, which has not been completely answered. We
  can, however, understand quite a lot about the motion <<p292>>of
  systems near equilibrium. The first step is to investigate the
  evolution of a linear approximation to the differential equations near
  the equilibrium. This part is easy, and is the subject of linear
  stability analysis. Later, we will address what the linear analysis
  implies for the actual problem.

  Consider a system of ordinary differential equations

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {Dz(t) = F(t,z(t))} & {(4.1)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  with components

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {Dz^{i}(t) = F^{i}(t,z^{0}(t),\ldots,z^{n - 1}(t)),} & {(4.2)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /n/ is the dimension. An equilibrium point of this system of
  equations is a point /z_{e}/ for which the state derivative is zero:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {0 = F(t,z_{e}).} & {(4.3)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  That this is zero at all moments for the equilibrium solution implies
  ∂_{0}/F/ (/t/, /z_{e}/) = 0.

  Next consider a path /z/′ that passes near the equilibrium point. The
  path displacement /ζ/ is defined so that at time /t/

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {z\prime(t) = z_{e} + \zeta(t).} & {(4.4)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  We have

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {D\zeta(t) = Dz\prime(t) = F(t,z_{e} + \zeta(t)).} & {(4.5)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  If /ζ/ is small we can write the right-hand side as a Taylor series in
  /ζ/:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {D\zeta(t) = F(t,z_{e}) + \partial_{1}F(t,z_{e})\zeta(t) + \cdots,} & {(4.6)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  but the first term is zero because /z_{e}/ is an equilibrium point, so

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {D\zeta(t) = \partial_{1}F(t,z_{e})\zeta(t) + \cdots.} & {(4.7)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  If /ζ/ is small the evolution is approximated by the linear terms.
  Linear stability analysis investigates the evolution of the
  approximate equation

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {D\zeta(t) = \partial_{1}F(t,z_{e})\zeta(t).} & {(4.8)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  <<p293>>

  These are the variational equations
  ([[file:chapter003.html#disp_3.145][3.145]]) with the equilibrium
  solution substituted for the reference trajectory. The relationship of
  the solutions of this linearized system to the full system is a
  difficult mathematical problem, which has not been fully resolved.

  If we restrict attention to autonomous systems (∂_{0}/F/ = 0), then
  the variational equations at an equilibrium are a linear system of
  ordinary differential equations with constant
  coefficients.^{[[#endnote_2][2]]} Such systems can be solved
  analytically. To simplify the notation, let /M/ = ∂_{1}/F/(/t/,
  /z_{e}/), so

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {D\zeta(t) = M\zeta(t).} & {(4.9)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  We seek a solution of the form

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\zeta(t) = \alpha e^{\lambda t},} & {(4.10)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /α/ is a structured constant with the same number of components
  as /ζ/, and /λ/ is a complex number called a /characteristic
  exponent/. Substituting, we find

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\lambda\alpha e^{\lambda t} = M\alpha e^{\lambda t}.} & {(4.11)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  The exponential factor is not zero, so we find

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {M\alpha = \lambda\alpha,} & {(4.12)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  which is an equation for the eigenvalue /λ/ and (normalized)
  eigen-vector /α/. In general, there are /n/ eigenvalues and /n/
  eigenvectors, so we must add a subscript to both /α/ and /λ/
  indicating the particular solution. The general solution is an
  arbitrary linear combination of these individual solutions. The
  eigenvalues are solutions of the characteristic equation

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {0 = \det(\mathbf{M} - \lambda\mathbf{I})} & {(4.13)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where *M* is the matrix representation of /M/, and *I* is the identity
  matrix of the same dimension. The elements of *M* are real, so we know
  that the eigenvalues /λ/ either are real or come in complex-conjugate
  pairs. We assume the eigenvalues are all distinct.^{[[#endnote_3][3]]}

  <<p294>>

  If the eigenvalue is real then the solution is exponential, as
  assumed. If the eigenvalue /λ/ > 0 then the solution expands
  exponentially along the direction /α/; if /λ/ < 0 then the solution
  contracts exponentially along the direction /α/.

  If the eigenvalue is complex we can form real solutions by combining
  the two solutions for the complex-conjugate pair of eigenvalues. Let
  /λ/ = /a/ + /ib/, with real /a/ and /b/, be one such complex
  eigenvalue. Let /α/ = /u/ + /iv/, where /u/ and /v/ are real, be the
  eigen-vector corresponding to it. So there is a complex solution of
  the form

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\zeta_{c}(t)} & {= (u + iv)e^{(a + ib)t}} & \\
   & {= (u + iv)e^{at}(\cos\, bt + i\,\sin\, bt)} & \\
   & {= e^{at}(u\,\cos\, bt - v\,\sin\, bt) + ie^{at}(u\,\sin\, bt + v\,\cos\, bt).} & {(4.14)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  The complex conjugate of this solution is also a solution, because the
  ordinary differential equation is linear with real linear
  coefficients. This complex-conjugate solution is associated with the
  eigenvalue that is the complex conjugate of the original complex
  eigenvalue. So the real and imaginary parts of /ζ_{c}/ are real
  solutions:

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\zeta_{a}(t)} & {= e^{at}(u\,\cos\, bt - v\,\sin\, bt)} & \\
  {\zeta_{b}(t)} & {= e^{at}(u\,\sin\, bt + v\,\cos\, bt).} & {(4.15)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  These two solutions reside in the plane containing the vectors /u/ and
  /v/. If /a/ is positive both solutions spiral outwards exponentially,
  and if /a/ is negative they both spiral inwards. If /a/ is zero, both
  solutions trace the same ellipse, but with different phases.

  Again, the general solution is an arbitrary linear combination of the
  particular real solutions corresponding to the various eigenvalues. So
  if we denote the /k/th real eigensolution /ζ_{k}/(/t/), then the
  general solution is

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\zeta(t) = {\sum\limits_{k}{A_{k}\zeta_{k}(t),}}} & {(4.16)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where /A_{k}/ may be determined by the initial conditions (the state
  at a given time).

  *Exercise 4.1: Pendulum*

  Carry out the details of finding the eigensolutions for the two
  equilibria of the pendulum (/θ/ = 0 and /θ/ = /π/, both with /p_{θ}/ =
  0). How is the <<p295>>small-amplitude oscillation frequency related
  to the eigenvalues? How are the eigendirections related to the
  contours of the Hamiltonian?

  *** *4.2.2 Fixed Points of Maps*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_4-2-2
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  Fixed points on a surface of section correspond either to equilibrium
  points of the system or to a periodic motion of the system. Linear
  stability analysis of fixed points of maps is similar to the linear
  stability analysis for equilibrium points of systems governed by
  differential equations.

  Let /T/ be a map of the state space onto itself, as might be generated
  by a surface of section. A trajectory sequence is generated by
  successive iteration of the map /T/. Let /x/(/n/) be the /n/th point
  of the sequence. The map carries one point of the trajectory sequence
  to the next: /x/(/n/ + 1) = /T/(/x/(/n/)). We can represent successive
  iterations of the map by a superscript, so that /T ^{i}/ indicates /T/
  composed /i/ times. For example, /T/^{2}(/x/) = /T/ (/T/(/x/)). Thus
  /x/(/n/) = /T^{n}/(/x/(0)).^{[[#endnote_4][4]]}

  A /fixed point x/_{0} of the map /T/ satisfies

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {x_{0} = T(x_{0}).} & {(4.17)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  A /periodic point/ of the map /T/ is a point that is visited every /k/
  iterations of /T/. Thus it is a fixed point of the map /T^{k}/. So the
  behavior near a periodic point can be ascertained by looking at the
  behavior near an associated fixed point of /T^{k}/.

  Let /x/ be some trajectory initially near the fixed point /x/_{0} of
  /T/, and /ξ/ be the deviation from /x/_{0}: /x/(/n/) = /x/_{0} +
  /ξ/(/n/). The trajectory satisfies

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {x_{0} + \xi(n + 1) = T(x_{0} + \xi(n)).} & {(4.18)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  Expanding the right-hand side as a Taylor series, we obtain

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {x_{0} + \xi(n + 1) = T(x_{0}) + DT(x_{0})\xi(n) + \cdots,} & {(4.19)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  but /x/_{0} = /T/(/x/_{0}) so

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\xi(n + 1) = DT(x_{0})\xi(n) + \cdots.} & {(4.20)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  <<p296>>

  Linear stability analysis considers the evolution of the system
  truncated to the linear terms

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\xi(n + 1) = DT(x_{0})\xi(n).} & {(4.21)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  This is a system of linear difference equations, with constant
  coefficients /DT/(/x/_{0}).

  We assume there are solutions of the form

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\xi(n) = \rho^{n}\alpha,} & {(4.22)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where /ρ/ is some (complex) number, called a /characteristic
  multiplier/.^{[[#endnote_5][5]]} Substituting this solution into the
  linearized evolution equation, we find

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\rho\alpha = DT(x_{0})\alpha,} & {(4.23)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  or

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {(DT(x_{0}) - \rho I)\alpha = 0,} & {(4.24)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where /I/ is the identity multiplier. We see that /ρ/ is an eigenvalue
  of the linear transformation /DT/(/x/_{0}) and /α/ is the associated
  (normalized) eigenvector. Let /M/ = /DT/(/x/_{0}), and *M* be its
  matrix representation. The eigenvalues are determined by

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\det(\mathbf{M} - \rho\mathbf{I}) = 0.} & {(4.25)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  The elements of *M* are real, so the eigenvalues /ρ/ are either real
  or come in complex-conjugate pairs.^{[[#endnote_6][6]]}

  For the real eigenvalues the solutions are just exponential expansion
  or contraction along the associated eigenvector /α/:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\xi(n) = \rho^{n}\alpha.} & {(4.26)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  The solution is expanding if |/ρ/| > 1 and contracting if |/ρ/| < 1.

  If the eigenvalues are complex, then the solution is complex, but the
  complex solutions corresponding to the complex-conjugate pair of
  eigenvalues can be combined to form two real solutions, as was done
  for the equilibrium solutions. Let /ρ/ = /e/^{/A/+/iB/} with real
  <<p297>>/A/ and /B/, and /α/ = /u/ + /iv/. A calculation similar to
  that for the equilibrium case shows that there are two real solutions

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  {\xi_{a}(n)} & {= \text{e}^{An}\,(u\,\cos\, Bn - v\,\sin\, Bn)} & \\
  {\xi_{b}(n)} & {= \text{e}^{An}\,(u\,\sin\, Bn + v\,\cos\, Bn).} & {(4.27)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  We see that if /A/ > 0 then the solution exponentially expands, and if
  /A/ < 0 the solution exponentially contracts. Exponential expansion,
  /A/ > 0, corresponds to |/ρ/| > 1; exponential contraction, /A/ < 0,
  corresponds to |/ρ/| < 1. If /A/ = 0 then the two real solutions trace
  an ellipse and any linear combination of them traces an ellipse.

  The general solution is an arbitrary linear combination of the
  eigensolutions. Let /ξ_{k}/ be the /k/th real eigensolution. The
  general solution is

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\xi(n) = {\sum\limits_{k}{A_{k}\xi_{k}(n),}}} & {(4.28)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where /A_{k}/ may be determined by the initial conditions.

  *Exercise 4.2: Elliptical oscillation*

  Show that the arbitrary linear combination of /ξ_{a}/ and /ξ_{b}/
  traces an ellipse for /A/ = 0.

  *Exercise 4.3: Standard map*

  The standard map (see [[file:chapter003.html#h1-21b][section 3.9]])
  has fixed points at /I/ = 0 for /θ/ = 0 and /θ/ = /π/. Find the full
  eigensolutions for these two fixed points. For what ranges of the
  parameter /K/ are the fixed points linearly stable or unstable?

  *** *4.2.3 Relations Among Exponents*
      :PROPERTIES:

      :END:
  For maps that are generated by stroboscopic sampling of the evolution
  of a system of autonomous differential equations, equilibrium points
  are fixed points of the map. The eigensolutions of the equilibrium of
  the flow and the eigensolutions of the map at the fixed point are then
  related. Let /τ/ be the sampling period. Then

  $\rho_{i} = e^{\lambda_{i}\tau}$

  .

  The Lyapunov exponent is a measure of the rate of exponential
  divergence of nearby trajectories from a reference trajectory. If the
  reference trajectory is an equilibrium of a flow, then the Lyapunov
  exponents are the real parts of the linearized characteristic
  <<p298>>exponents /λ_{i}/. If the reference trajectory is a fixed
  point of a map generated by a flow (either a periodic orbit or an
  equilibrium), then the Lyapunov exponents are real parts of the
  logarithm of the characteristic multipliers, divided by the period of
  the map. So if the characteristic multiplier is /ρ/ = /e/^{/A/+/iB/}
  and the period of the map is /τ/, then the Lyapunov exponent is
  /A///τ/. A positive Lyapunov exponent of a fixed point indicates
  linear instability of the fixed point.

  The Lyapunov exponent has less information than the characteristic
  multipliers or exponents because the imaginary part is lost. However,
  the Lyapunov exponent is more generally applicable in that it is well
  defined even for reference trajectories that are not periodic.

  In the linear analysis of the fixed point, each characteristic
  multiplier corresponds to a subspace of possible linear solutions. For
  instance, for a real characteristic multiplier there is a
  corresponding eigendirection, and for any initial displacement along
  this direction successive iterates are also along this direction.
  Complex-conjugate pairs of multipliers correspond to a plane of
  solutions. For a displacement initially on this plane, successive
  iterates are also on this plane.

  It turns out that something like this is also the case for the
  linearized solutions near a reference trajectory that is not at a
  fixed point. For each nonzero Lyapunov exponent there is a twisting
  subspace, so that for an initial displacement in this subspace
  successive iterates also belong to the subspace. At different points
  along the reference trajectory the unit displacement vector that
  characterizes the direction of this subspace is different.

  For Hamiltonian systems there are additional constraints among the
  eigenvalues.

  Consider first the case of two-dimensional surfaces of section. We
  have seen that Hamiltonian surfaces of section preserve area. As we
  saw in the proof of Liouville's theorem, area preservation implies
  that the determinant of the derivative of the transformation is 1. At
  a fixed point /x/_{0} the linearized map is /ξ/(/n/ + 1) =
  /DT/(/x/_{0})/ξ/(/n/). So /M/ = /DT/(/x/_{0}) has unit determinant.
  The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, so for a fixed
  point on a Hamiltonian surface of section the two eigenvalues must be
  inverses of each other. We also have the constraint that if an
  eigen-value is complex then the complex conjugate of the eigenvalue is
  also an eigenvalue. These two conditions imply that the eigenvalues
  must either be real and inverses, or be complex-conjugate pairs on the
  unit circle (see [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-4][figure 4.4]]).

  <<p299>>

  #+caption: *Figure 4.4* The eigenvalues for fixed points of a
  two-dimensional Hamiltonian map. The eigenvalues either are real or
  are complex-conjugate pairs that lie on the unit circle. For each
  eigenvalue the inverse is also an eigenvalue.
  [[file:images/Art_P845.jpg]]

  Fixed points for which the characteristic multipliers all lie on the
  unit circle are called /elliptic/ fixed points. The solutions of the
  linearized variational equations trace ellipses around the fixed
  point. Elliptic fixed points are linearly stable.

  Fixed points with positive real characteristic multipliers are called
  /hyperbolic/ fixed points. For two-dimensional maps, there is an
  exponentially expanding subspace and an exponentially contracting
  subspace. The general solution is a linear combination of these. Fixed
  points for which the characteristic multipliers are negative are
  called /hyperbolic with reflection/.

  The edge case of a double root of the characteristic equation is
  called /parabolic/. In this case the general solution grows linearly.
  This happens at points of bifurcation where elliptic points become
  hyperbolic points or vice versa.

  <<p300>>

  #+caption: *Figure 4.5* If there is more than one degree of freedom
  the eigenvalues for fixed points of a Hamiltonian map may lie in a
  quartet, with two complex-conjugate pairs. The magnitudes of the pairs
  must be inverses. This enforces the constraint that the expansion
  produced by the roots with magnitude greater than one is
  counterbalanced by the contraction produced by the roots with
  magnitude smaller than one.
  [[file:images/Art_P846.jpg]]

  For two-dimensional Hamiltonian maps these are the only possibilities.
  For higher-dimensional Hamiltonian maps, we can get combinations of
  these: some characteristic multipliers can be real and others
  complex-conjugate pairs. We might imagine that in addition there would
  be many other types of fixed points that occur in higher dimensions.
  In fact, there is only one additional type, shown in
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-5][figure 4.5]]. For Hamiltonian systems
  of arbitrary dimensions it is still the case that for each eigenvalue
  the complex conjugate and the inverse are also eigenvalues. We can
  prove this starting from a result in chapter 5. Consider the map
  /T_{β}/ of the phase space onto itself that is generated by time
  evolution of a Hamiltonian system by time increment /β/. Let /z/ =
  (/q/, /p/); then the map /T_{β}/ satisfies /z/(/t/ + /β/) =
  /T_{β}/(/z/(/t/)) for solutions /z/ of Hamilton's equations. We will
  show in chapter 5 that the derivative of the <<p301>>map /T_{β}/ is
  symplectic, whether or not the starting point is at a fixed point. A
  2/n/ × 2/n/ matrix *M* is /symplectic/ if it satisfies

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\mathbf{MJ}\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}} = \mathbf{J},} & {(4.29)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where *J* is the 2/n/-dimensional symplectic unit:

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\mathbf{J} = \left( \begin{array}{ll}
  \mathbf{0}_{n \times n} & \mathbf{1}_{n \times n} \\
  {\mathbf{-}\mathbf{1}_{n \times n}} & \mathbf{0}_{n \times n} \\
  \end{array} \right),} & {(4.30)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  with the /n/ × /n/ unit matrix *1*_{/n/×/n/} and the /n/ × /n/ zero
  matrix *0*_{/n/×/n/}.

  Using the symplectic property, we can show that in general for each
  eigenvalue its inverse is also an eigenvalue. Assume /ρ/ is an
  eigenvalue, so that /ρ/ satisfies det(*M* − /ρ/*I*) = 0. This equation
  is unchanged if *M* is replaced by its transpose, so /ρ/ is also an
  eigenvalue of

  $\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}$

  :

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}}\mathbf{\alpha}\prime = \rho\mathbf{\alpha}\prime.} & {(4.31)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  From this we can see that

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\frac{1}{\rho}\mathbf{\alpha}\prime = {(\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}})}^{- 1}\mathbf{\alpha}\prime.} & {(4.32)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  Now, from the symplectic property we have

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\mathbf{MJ} = \mathbf{J}{(\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}})}^{- 1}.} & {(4.33)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  So

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\mathbf{MJ}\mathbf{\alpha}\prime = \mathbf{J}{(\mathbf{M}^{\mathcal{T}})}^{- 1}\mathbf{\alpha}\prime = \frac{1}{\rho}\mathbf{J}\mathbf{\alpha}\prime,} & {(4.34)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  and we can conclude that 1//ρ/ is an eigenvalue of *M* with the
  eigenvector *J/α/′*. From the fact that for every eigenvalue its
  inverse is also an eigenvalue we deduce that the determinant of the
  transformation *M*, which is the product of the eigenvalues, is one.

  Thus the constraints that the eigenvalues must be associated with
  inverses and complex conjugates yields exactly one new pattern of
  eigenvalues in higher dimensions. [[#Fig_4-5][Figure 4.5]] shows the
  only new pattern that is possible.

  We have seen that the Lyapunov exponents for fixed points are related
  to the characteristic multipliers for the fixed points, <<p302>>so the
  Hamiltonian constraints on the multipliers correspond to Hamiltonian
  constraints for Lyapunov exponents at fixed points. For each
  characteristic multiplier, the inverse is also a characteristic
  multiplier. This means that at fixed points, for each positive
  Lyapunov exponent there is a corresponding negative Lyapunov exponent
  with the same magnitude. It turns out that this is also true if the
  reference trajectory is not at a fixed point. For Hamiltonian systems,
  for each positive Lyapunov exponent there is a corresponding negative
  exponent of equal magnitude.

  A fixed point that is linearly unstable indicates that the full system
  is unstable at that point. This means that trajectories starting near
  the fixed point diverge from the fixed point. On the other hand,
  linear stability of a fixed point does not generally guarantee that
  the full system is stable at that point. For a two-degree-of-freedom
  Hamiltonian system, the Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theorem proves under
  certain conditions that linear stability implies nonlinear stability.
  In higher dimensions, though, it is not known whether linear stability
  implies nonlinear stability.

  * *4.3 Homoclinic Tangle*

    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  For the driven pendulum we observe that as the amplitude of the drive
  is increased the separatrix of the undriven pendulum is where the most
  prominent chaotic zone appears. Here we examine in great detail the
  motion in the vicinity of the separatrix. What emerges is a remarkably
  complicated picture, first discovered by Henri Poincaré. Indeed,
  Poincaré stated (see the epigraph to this chapter) that the picture
  that emerged was so complicated that he was not even going to attempt
  to draw it. We will review the argument leading to the picture, and
  compute enough of it to convince ourselves of its reality.

  The separatrix of the undriven pendulum is made up of two trajectories
  that are asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium. In the driven
  pendulum with zero drive, an infinite number of distinct
  <<p303>>orbits lie on the separatrix; they are distinguished by the
  phase of the drive. These orbits are asymptotic to the unstable fixed
  point both forward and backward in time.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.6* The stable and unstable manifolds of the
  unstable fixed point for the pendulum are compared to the stable and
  unstable manifolds of the linearized variational system in the
  vicinity of the fixed point. The axes are centered at the fixed point
  (±/π/, 0). The linear stable and unstable manifolds are labeled by
  V^{s} and V^{u} respectively; the nonlinear stable and unstable
  manifolds are labeled by W^{s} and W^{u}.
  [[file:images/Art_P853.jpg]]

  Notice that close to the unstable fixed point the sets of points that
  are asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium must be tangent to the
  linear variational eigenvectors at the fixed point. (See
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-6][figure 4.6]].) In a sense, the sets of
  orbits that are asymptotic to the fixed point are extensions to the
  nonlinear problem of the sets of orbits that are asymptotic to the
  fixed point in the linearized problem.

  The set of points that are asymptotic to an unstable fixed point
  forward in time is called the /stable manifold/ of the fixed point.
  The set of points that are asymptotic to an unstable fixed point
  backward in time is called the /unstable manifold/. For the driven
  pendulum with zero-amplitude drive, all points on the separatrix are
  asymptotic both forward and backward in time to the unstable
  <<p304>>fixed point. So in this case the stable and unstable manifolds
  coincide.

  If the drive amplitude is nonzero then there are still one-dimensional
  sets of points that are asymptotic to the unstable fixed point forward
  and backward in time: there are still stable and unstable manifolds.
  Why? The behavior near the fixed point is described by the linearized
  variational system. For the linear variational system, points in the
  space spanned by the unstable eigenvector, when mapped backwards in
  time, are asymptotic to the fixed point. Points slightly off this
  curve may initially approach the unstable equilibrium, but eventually
  will fall away to one side or the other. For the driven system with
  small drive, there must still be a curve that separates the points
  that fall away to one side from the points that fall away to the other
  side. Points on the dividing curve must be asymptotic to the unstable
  equilibrium. The dividing set cannot have positive area because the
  map is area preserving.

  For the zero-amplitude drive case, the stable and unstable manifolds
  are contours of the conserved Hamiltonian. For nonzero amplitude the
  Hamiltonian is no longer conserved, and the stable manifolds and
  unstable manifolds no longer coincide. This is generally true for
  non-integrable systems: stable and unstable manifolds do not coincide.

  If the stable and unstable manifolds no longer coincide, where do they
  go? A stable manifold cannot cross another stable manifold, and an
  unstable manifold cannot cross another unstable manifold, because the
  crossing point would be asymptotic to two different fixed points. A
  stable manifold or unstable manifold may not cross itself, as shown
  below. However, a stable and an unstable manifold may cross one
  another.

  Actually, the stable and unstable manifolds must cross at some point.
  The only other possibilities are that they run off to infinity or
  spiral around. We will see that in general there are barriers to
  running away. Area preservation excludes the existence of attractors,
  and this can be used to exclude the spiraling case. A finite region of
  initial conditions between two successive arms of the spiral will
  eventually run out of area as the spiral progresses.

  So the only possibility is that the stable and unstable manifolds
  cross, as is illustrated in [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-7][figure
  4.7]]. The point of crossing of a stable and unstable manifold is
  called a /homoclinic intersection/ if the stable and unstable
  manifolds belong to the same unstable <<p305>>fixed point. It is
  called a /heteroclinic intersection/ if the stable and unstable
  manifolds belong to different fixed points.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.7* For nonzero drive the stable and unstable
  manifolds no longer coincide and in general cross. The dashed circle
  indicates the central intersection. Forward and backward images of
  this intersection are themselves intersections. Because the orbits are
  asymptotic to the fixed point there is an infinity of such
  intersections.
  [[file:images/Art_P854.jpg]]

  If the stable and unstable manifolds cross once then there is an
  infinite number of other crossings. The intersection point belongs to
  both the stable and unstable manifolds. That it is on the unstable
  manifold means that all images forward and backward in time also
  belong to the unstable manifold, and likewise for points on the stable
  manifold. Thus all images of the intersection belong to both the
  stable and unstable manifolds. So these images must be additional
  crossings of the two manifolds.

  We can deduce that there are still more intersections of the stable
  and unstable manifolds. The maps we are considering not only preserve
  area but also orientation. In the proof of Liouville's theorem we
  showed that the determinant of the transformation is one, not just
  magnitude one. If we consider little segments of the stable and
  unstable manifolds near the intersection point, then these segments
  must map near the image of the intersection point. That the map
  preserves orientation implies that the manifolds are crossing one
  another in the same sense as at the previous intersection. Therefore
  there must have been at least one more crossing of the stable and
  unstable manifolds in between these two. This <<p306>>is illustrated
  in [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-8][figure 4.8]]. Of course, all
  forward and backward images of these intermediate intersections are
  also intersections.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.8* Orientation preservation implies that between
  an intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds and the image of
  this intersection there is another intersection. Thus there are two
  alternating families of intersections. The central intersection and
  its pre-images and post-images are labeled A_{/i/}. Another family is
  labeled B_{/i/}.
  [[file:images/Art_P855.jpg]]

  As the picture gets more complicated, keep in mind that the stable
  manifold cannot cross itself and the unstable manifold cannot cross
  itself. Suppose one did, say by making a little loop. The image of
  this loop under the map must also be a loop. So if there were a loop
  there would have to be an infinite number of loops. That would be
  okay, but what happens as the loop gets close to the fixed point?
  There would still have to be loops, but then the stable and unstable
  manifolds would not have the right behavior: the stable and unstable
  manifolds of the linearized map do not have loops. Therefore, the
  stable and unstable manifolds cannot cross
  themselves.^{[[#endnote_7][7]]}

  We are not done yet! The lobes that are defined by successive
  crossings of the stable and unstable manifolds enclose a certain area.
  The map is area preserving so all images of these lobes must have the
  same area. As the lobes approach the fixed point, we get an infinite
  number of lobes with a base of exponentially shrinking length. The
  stable and unstable manifolds cannot cross <<p307>>themselves, so to
  pack these lobes together on the plane the lobes must stretch out to
  preserve area. We see that the length of the lobe must grow roughly
  exponentially (it may not be uniform in width so it need not be
  exactly exponential). This exponential lengthening of the lobes no
  doubt bears some responsibility for the exponential divergence of
  nearby trajectories of chaotic orbits, but does not prove it. It does,
  however, suggest a connection between the fact that chaotic orbits
  appear to occupy an area on the section and the fact that nearby
  chaotic orbits diverge exponentially.

  Actually, the situation is even more complicated. As the lobes
  stretch, they form tendrils that wrap around the separatrix region.
  The tendrils of the unstable manifold can cross the tendrils of the
  stable manifold. Each point of crossing is a new homoclinic
  intersection, and so each pre- and post-image of this point belongs to
  both the stable and unstable manifolds, indicating another crossing of
  these curves. We could go on and on. No wonder Poincaré refused to
  draw this mess.

  *Exercise 4.5: Homoclinic paradox*

  How do we fit an infinite number of copies of a finite area in a
  finite region, without allowing the stable and unstable manifolds to
  cross themselves? Resolve this apparent paradox.

  *** *4.3.1 Computation of Stable and Unstable Manifolds*
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_4-3-1
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  The homoclinic tangle is not just a bad dream. We can actually compute
  it.

  Very close to an unstable fixed point the stable and unstable
  manifolds become indistinguishable from the rays along the
  eigen-vectors of the linearized system. So one way to compute the
  unstable manifold is to take a line of initial conditions close to the
  fixed point along the unstable manifold of the linearized system and
  evolve them forward in time. Similarly, the stable manifold can be
  constructed by taking a line of initial conditions along the stable
  manifold of the linearized system and evolving them backward in time.

  We can do better than this by choosing a parameter (like arc length)
  along the manifold and for each value of the parameter deciding how
  many iterations of the map would be required to take the point back to
  within some small region of the fixed point. We then choose an initial
  condition along the linearized eigenvectors <<p308>>and iterate the
  point back with the map. This idea is implemented in the following
  program:^{[[#endnote_8][8]]}

  {% highlight scheme %} (define ((unstable-manifold T xe ye dx dy rho
  eps) param) (let ((n (floor->exact (/ (log (/ param eps)) (log
  rho))))) ((iterated-map T n) (+ xe (* dx (/ param (expt rho n)))) (+
  ye (* dy (/ param (expt rho n)))) make-point (lambda () (error
  "Failed"))))) {% endhighlight %}

  where T is the map, xe and ye are the coordinates of the fixed point,
  dx and dy are components of the linearized eigenvector, rho is the
  characteristic multiplier, eps is a scale within which the linearized
  map is a good enough approximation to T, and param is a continuous
  parameter along the manifold. The procedure make-point, supplied as
  the success continuation for the iterated map, packages two numbers.
  They can be split with abscissa and ordinate.

  The program assumes that there is a basic exponential divergence along
  the manifold---that is why we take the logarithm of param to get
  initial conditions in the linear regime. This assumption is not
  exactly true, but it is good enough for now.

  The curve is generated by a call to plot-parametric-fill, which
  recursively subdivides intervals of the parameter until there are
  enough points to get a smooth curve.

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (plot-parametric-fill win f a b near?)
  (let loop ((a a) (xa (f a)) (b b) (xb (f b))) (if (not (close-enuf? a
  b (* 10 *machine-epsilon*))) (let ((m (/ (+ a b) 2))) (let ((xm (f
  m))) (plot-point win (abscissa xm) (ordinate xm)) (if (not (near? xa
  xm)) (loop a xa m xm)) (if (not (near? xb xm)) (loop m xm b xb)))))))
  {% endhighlight %}

  The near? argument is a test for whether two points are within a given
  distance of each other in the graph. Because some coordinates are
  angle variables, this may involve a principal value comparison. For
  example, for the driven pendulum section, the <<p309>>horizontal axis
  is an angle but the vertical axis is not, so the picture is on a
  cylinder:

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (cylinder-near? eps) (let ((eps2
  (square eps))) (lambda (point1 point2) (< (+ (square ((principal-value
  pi) (- (abscissa point1) (abscissa point2)))) (square (- (ordinate
  point1) (ordinate point2)))) eps2)))) {% endhighlight %}

  If an /n/-degree-of-freedom system has /n/ independent conserved
  quantities then the solution of the problem can be reduced to
  quadratures. Such a system is called /integrable/. Typically, the
  phase space of integrable systems is divided into regions of
  qualitatively different behavior. For example, the motion of a
  pendulum is reducible to quadratures and has three distinct types of
  solutions: the oscillating solutions and the clockwise and
  counterclockwise circulating solutions. The different regions of the
  pendulum phase space are separated by the trajectories that are
  asymptotic to the unstable equilibrium. It turns out that for any
  system that is reducible to quadratures, a set of phase-space
  coordinates can be chosen for each region of the phase space so that
  the Hamiltonian describing the motion in that region depends only on
  the momenta. Furthermore, if the phase space is bounded then the
  generalized coordinates can be chosen to be angles (that are
  2/π/-periodic). The configuration space described by /n/ angles is an
  /n/-torus. The momenta conjugate to these angles are called /actions/.
  Such phase-space coordinates are called /action-angle/ coordinates. We
  will see later how to reformulate systems in this way. Here we explore
  the consequences of such a formulation; this formulation is especially
  useful for finding out what happens as additional effects are added to
  integrable problems.

  Suppose we have a time-independent /n/-degree-of-freedom system that
  is reducible to quadratures. For each region of phase space there is a
  local formulation of the system so that the evolution of the system is
  described by a time-independent Hamiltonian that depends only on the
  momenta. Suppose further that the coordinates are all angles. Let /θ/
  be the tuple of angles and /J/ be the tuple of conjugate momenta. The
  Hamiltonian is

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {H(t,\theta,J) = f(J).} & {(4.35)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  Hamilton's equations are simply

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {DJ(t) = - \partial_{1}H(t,\theta(t),J(t)) = 0} & \\
  {D\theta(t) = \,\,\,\,\,\partial_{2}H(t,\theta(t),J(t)) = \omega(J(t)),} & {(4.36)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where /ω/(/J/) = /Df/(/J/) is a tuple of frequencies with a component
  for each degree of freedom. The momenta are all constant because
  <<p312>>the Hamiltonian does not depend on any of the coordinates. The
  motion of the coordinate angles is uniform; the rates of change of the
  angles are the frequencies /ω/, which depend only on the constant
  momenta. Given initial values /θ/(/t/_{0}) and /J/(/t/_{0}) at time
  /t/_{0}, the solutions are simple:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {J(t) = J(t_{0})} & \\
  {\theta(t) = \omega(J(t_{0}))(t - t_{0}) + \theta(t_{0}).} & {(4.37)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  Though the solutions are simple, there are two distinct orbit types:
  periodic orbits and quasiperiodic orbits, depending on the frequency
  ratios.

  A solution is /periodic/ if all the coordinates (and momenta) of the
  system return to their initial values at some later time. Each
  coordinate /θ^{i}/ with nonzero frequency /ω^{i}/(/J/(/t/_{0})) is
  periodic with a period /τ_{i}/ = 2/π///ω^{i}/(/J/(/t/_{0})). The
  period of the system must therefore be an integer multiple /k_{i}/ of
  each of the individual coordinate periods /τ_{i}/. If the system is
  periodic with some set of integer multiples, then it is also periodic
  with any common factors divided out. Thus the period of the system is
  /τ/ = (/k_{i}///d/)/τ_{i}/ where /d/ is the greatest common divisor of
  the integers /k_{i}/.

  For a system with two degrees of freedom, a solution is periodic if
  there exists a pair of relatively prime integers /k/ and /j/ such that
  /kω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0})) = /jω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})). The period of the
  system is /τ/ = 2/πj///ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0})) =
  2/πk///ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})); the frequency is
  /ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0}))//j/ = /ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0}))//k/. A periodic
  motion on the 2-torus is illustrated in
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-10][figure 4.10]].

  If the frequencies /ω^{i}/(/J/(/t/_{0})) satisfy an
  integer-coefficient relation

  $\sum_{i}{n_{i}\omega^{i}(J(t_{0})) = 0}$

  , we say that the frequencies satisfy a /commen-surability/. If there
  is no commensurability for any nonzero integer coefficients, we say
  that the frequencies are linearly independent (with respect to the
  integers) and the solution is /quasiperiodic/. One can prove that for
  /n/ incommensurate frequencies all solutions come arbitrarily close to
  every point in the configuration space.^{[[#endnote_10][10]]}

  For a system with two degrees of freedom the solutions in a region
  described by a particular set of action-angle variables are
  <<p313>>either periodic or quasiperiodic.^{[[#endnote_11][11]]} For
  systems with more than two degrees of freedom there are trajectories
  that are neither periodic nor quasiperiodic with /n/ frequencies.
  These are quasiperiodic with fewer frequencies and dense over a
  corresponding lower-dimensional torus.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.10* The solid and dotted lines show two periodic
  trajectories on the configuration coordinate plane. For commensurate
  frequencies the configuration motion is periodic, independent of the
  initial angles. In this illustration the frequencies satisfy
  2/ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0})) = 3/ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})). The orbits close
  after three cycles of /θ/^{0} and two cycles of /θ/^{1}, for any
  initial /θ/^{0} and /θ/^{1}.

  As we have seen, in action-angle coordinates the angles move with
  constant angular frequencies, and the momenta are constant. Thus
  surfaces of section in action-angle coordinates are particularly
  simple. We can make surfaces of section for time-independent
  two-degree-of-freedom systems or one-degree-of-freedom systems
  <<p314>>with periodic drive. In the latter case, one of the angles in
  the action-angle system is the phase of the drive. We make surfaces of
  section by accumulating points in one pair of canonical coordinates as
  the other coordinate goes through some particular value, such as zero.
  If we plot the section points with the angle coordinate on the
  abscissa and the conjugate momentum on the ordinate then the section
  points for all trajectories lie on horizontal lines, as illustrated in
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-11][figure 4.11]].

  action-angle coordinates a trajectory generates points on a horizontal
  line. Trajectories with frequencies that are commensurate with the
  sampling frequency produce a finite number of points, independent of
  the initial angle. Here we use different symbols to indicate section
  points for distinct trajectories with the same momentum /J/_{0}.
  Trajectories with frequencies that are incommensurate with the
  sampling frequency fill out a horizontal line densely.

  For definiteness, let the plane of the surface of section be the
  (/θ/^{0}, /J/_{0}) plane, and the section condition be /θ/^{1} = 0.
  The other momentum /J/_{1} is chosen so that all the trajectories have
  the same energy. The momenta are all constant, so for a given
  trajectory all points that are generated are constrained to a line of
  constant /J/_{0}.

  <<p315>>

  The time between section points is the period of /θ/^{1}: Δ/t/ =
  2/π///ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})) because a section point is generated for
  every cycle of /θ/^{1}. The angle between successive points on the
  section is /ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0}))Δ/t/ =
  /ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0}))2/π///ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})) = 2/πν/(/J/(/t/_{0})),
  where /ν/(/J/) = /ω/^{0}(/J/)//ω/^{1}(/J/) is called the /rotation
  number/ of the trajectory. Let

  $\widehat{\theta}\left( i \right)$

  and /Ĵ/(/i/) be the /i/th point (/i/ is an integer) in a sequence of
  points on the surface of section generated by a solution trajectory:

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i) = \theta^{0}(i\Delta t + t_{0})} & \\
  {\widehat{J}(i) = J_{0}(i\Delta t + t_{0}),} & {(4.38)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  where the system is assumed to be on the section at /t/ = /t/_{0}.
  Along a trajectory, the map from one section point

  $(\widehat{\theta}\left( i \right),\widehat{J}\left( i \right))$

  to the next

  $\left( {\widehat{\theta}\left( {i + 1} \right),\widehat{J}\left( {i + 1} \right)} \right)$

  is of the form:^{[[#endnote_12][12]]}

  $$\begin{array}{ll}
  {\left( \begin{array}{l}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i + 1)} \\
  {\widehat{J}(i + 1)} \\
  \end{array} \right) = T\left( \begin{array}{l}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i)} \\
  {\widehat{J}(i)} \\
  \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{l}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i) + 2\pi\widehat{\nu}(\widehat{J}(i))} \\
  {\widehat{J}(i)} \\
  \end{array} \right).} & {(4.39)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  As a function of the action on the section, the rotation number is

  $\widehat{v}\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right)} \right) = v\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right),J_{1}\left( t_{0} \right)} \right)$

  , where /J/_{1}(/t/_{0}) has the value required to be on the section,
  as for example by giving the correct energy. If the rotation number
  function

  $\widehat{\nu}$

  is strictly monotonic in the action coordinate on the section then the
  map is called a /twist map/.^{[[#endnote_13][13]]}

  On a surface of section the different types of orbits generate
  different patterns. If the two frequencies are commensurate, then the
  trajectory is periodic and only a finite number of points are
  generated on the surface of section. Each of the periodic solutions
  illustrated in [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-10][figure 4.10]]
  generates two points on the surface of section defined by /θ/^{1} = 0.
  If the frequencies are commensurate they satisfy a relation of the
  form /kω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0})) = /jω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})), where
  /J/(/t/_{0}) = (/Ĵ/(0), /J/_{1}(/t/_{0})) is the initial and constant
  value of the momentum tuple. The motion is periodic with frequency
  /ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0}))//j/ = /ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0}))//k/, so the period
  is 2/πj///ω/^{0}(/J/(/t/_{0})) = 2/πk///ω/^{1}(/J/(/t/_{0})). Thus
  this periodic orbit generates /k/ points on this <<p316>>surface of
  section. For trajectories with commensurate frequencies the rotation
  number is rational:

  $\widehat{v}\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right)} \right) = v\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right),J_{1}\left( t_{0} \right)} \right) = j/k$

  . The coordinate /θ/^{1} makes /k/ cycles while the coordinate /θ/^{0}
  makes /j/ cycles ([[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-10][figure 4.10]] shows
  a system with a rotation number of 3/2). The frequencies depend on the
  momenta but not on the coordinates, so the motion is periodic with the
  same period and rotation number for all initial angles given these
  momenta. Thus there is a continuous family of periodic orbits with
  different initial angles.

  If the two frequencies are incommensurate, then the 2-torus is filled
  densely. Thus the line on which the section points are generated is
  filled densely. Again, this is the case for any initial coordinates,
  because the frequencies depend only on the momenta. There are
  infinitely many such orbits that are distinct for a given set of
  frequencies.^{[[#endnote_14][14]]}

  How does this picture change if we add additional effects?

  One peculiar feature of the orbits in integrable systems is that there
  are continuous families of periodic orbits. The initial angles do not
  matter; the frequencies depend only on the actions. Contrast this with
  our earlier experience with surfaces of section in which periodic
  points are isolated, and associated with island chains. Henri Poincaré
  and George Birkhoff investigated periodic orbits of near-integrable
  systems, and found that typically for each rational rotation number
  there are a finite number of periodic points, half of which are
  linearly stable and half linearly unstable. Here we show how to
  construct the Poincaré--Birkhoff periodic points.

  Consider an integrable system described in action-angle coordinates by
  the Hamiltonian /H/_{0}(/t/, /θ/, /J/) = /f/(/J/). We add some small
  additional effect described by the term /H/_{1} in the Hamiltonian

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H = H_{0} + \mathit{\epsilon}H_{1}.} & {(4.40)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  An example of such a system is the periodically driven pendulum with
  small-amplitude drive. For zero-amplitude drive the driven
  <<p317>>pendulum is integrable, but not for small drive.
  Unfortunately, we do not yet have the tools to develop action-angle
  coordinates for the pendulum. A simpler problem that is already in
  action-angle form is the driven rotor, which is just the driven
  pendulum with gravity turned off. We can implement this by turning our
  driven pendulum on its side, making the plane of the pendulum
  horizontal. A Hamiltonian for the driven rotor is

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {H(t,\theta,p_{\theta}) = \frac{p_{\theta}^{2}}{2ml^{2}} + mlA\omega^{2}\,\cos\,\omega t\,\cos\,\theta,} & {(4.41)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  where /A/ is the amplitude of the drive with frequency /ω/, /m/ is the
  mass of the bob, and /l/ is the length of the rotor. For zero
  amplitude, the Hamiltonian is already in action-angle form in that it
  depends only on the momentum /p_{θ}/ and the coordinate is an angle.

  For an integrable system, the map generated on the surface of section
  is of the twist map form ([[file:chapter004.html#disp_4.39][4.39]]).
  With the addition of a small perturbation to the Hamiltonian, small
  corrections are added to the map

  $$\begin{array}{lll}
  \left( \begin{array}{l}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i + 1)} \\
  {\widehat{J}(i + 1)} \\
  \end{array} \right) & {= T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}\left( \begin{array}{l}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i)} \\
  {\widehat{J}(i)} \\
  \end{array} \right)} & \\
   & {= \left( \begin{array}{l}
  {\widehat{\theta}(i) + 2\pi\widehat{\nu}(\widehat{J}(i)) + \mathit{\epsilon}f(\widehat{\theta}(i),\widehat{J}(i))} \\
  {\widehat{J}(i) + \mathit{\epsilon}g(\widehat{\theta}(i),\widehat{J}(i))} \\
  \end{array} \right).} & {(4.42)} \\
  \end{array}$$

  Both the map /T/ and the perturbed map /T_{ϵ}/ are area preserving
  because the maps are generated as surfaces of section for Hamiltonian
  systems.

  Suppose we are interested in determining whether periodic orbits of a
  particular rational rotation number

  $\widehat{v}\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right)} \right) = j/k$

  exist in some interval of the action /α/ < /Ĵ/(0) < /β/. If the
  rotation number is strictly monotonic in this interval and orbits with
  the rotation number

  $\widehat{v}\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right)} \right)$

  occur in this interval for the unperturbed map /T/, then by a simple
  construction we can show that periodic orbits with this rotation
  number also exist for /T_{ϵ}/ for sufficiently small /ϵ/.

  If a point is periodic for rational rotation number

  $\widehat{v}\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right)} \right) = j/k$

  , with relatively prime /j/ and /k/, we expect /k/ distinct images of
  the point to appear on the section. So if we consider the /k/th
  iterate of the map then the point is a fixed point of the map. For
  rational rotation number /j///k/ the map /T^{k}/ has a fixed point for
  every initial angle.

  <<p318>>

  #+caption: *Figure 4.12* The map /T^{k}/ has a line of fixed points if
  the rotation number is the rational /j///k/. Points above this line
  map to larger /θ/^{0}; points below this line map to smaller /θ/^{0}.
  [[file:images/Art_P869.jpg]]

  #+caption: *Figure 4.13* The map ¶ $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$ ¶ is
  slightly different from /T^{k}/, but above the central region points
  still map to larger /θ/^{0} and below the central region they map to
  smaller /θ/^{0}. By continuity there are points between for which
  /θ/^{0} does not change.
  [[file:images/Art_P870.jpg]]

  The rotation number of the map /T/ is strictly monotonic. Suppose for
  definiteness we assume the rotation number

  $\widehat{v}\left( {\widehat{J}\left( 0 \right)} \right)$

  increases with /Ĵ/(0). For some /Ĵ/^{∗} such that /α/ < /Ĵ/^{∗} < /β/
  the rotation number is /j///k/, and (

  ${\widehat{\theta}}^{\ast},{\widehat{J}}^{\ast}$

  ) is a fixed point of /T^{k}/ for any initial

  ${\widehat{\theta}}^{\ast}$

  . For /Ĵ/^{∗} the rotation number of /T^{k}/ is zero. The rotation
  number of the map /T/ is monotonically increasing so for /Ĵ/(0) >
  /Ĵ/^{∗} the rotation number of /T^{k}/ is positive, and for /Ĵ/(0) <
  /Ĵ/^{∗} the rotation number of /T^{k}/ is negative, as long as /Ĵ/(0)
  is not too far from /Ĵ/^{∗}. See
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-12][figure 4.12]].

  <<p319>>

  #+caption: *Figure 4.14* The solid curve /C/_{0} consists of points
  that map to the same /θ/^{0} under ¶ $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$ ¶ .
  The image /C/_{1} of /C/_{0} under ¶ $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$ ¶ is
  the dotted curve. Area preservation implies that these curves cross.
  [[file:images/Art_P871.jpg]]

  Now consider the map

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  . In general, for small /ϵ/, points map to slightly different points
  under /T_{ϵ}/ than they do under /T/, but not too different. So we can
  expect that there is still some interval in /Ĵ/(0) near /Ĵ/^{∗} such
  that for /Ĵ/(0) in the upper end of the interval,

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  maps points to larger /θ/^{0}, and for points in the lower end of the
  interval,

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  maps points to smaller /θ/^{0}. If this is the case then for every

  $\widehat{\theta}\left( 0 \right)$

  there is a point somewhere in the interval, some

  ${\widehat{J}}^{+}\left( {\widehat{\theta}\left( 0 \right)} \right)$

  , for which /θ/^{0} does not change, by continuity. These are not
  fixed points because the momentum /J/_{0} generally changes. See
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-13][figure 4.13]].

  The map is continuous, so we can expect that /Ĵ/^{+} is a continuous
  function of the /θ/^{0}. The twist-map condition (see footnote
  [[#endnote_13][13]]) ensures that /Ĵ/^{+} is periodic, so /Ĵ/^{+}(0) =
  /Ĵ/^{+}(2/π/). The twist-map condition also guarantees that for
  sufficiently small perturbations there cannot be more than one
  radially-mapping point for any angle. So the set of points that do not
  change /θ/^{0} under

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  form some periodic function of /θ/^{0}. Call this curve /C/_{0}. See
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-14][figure 4.14]].

  The map

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  takes the curve /C/_{0} to another curve /C/_{1} that, like /C/_{0},
  is continuous and periodic. The two curves /C/_{0} and /C/_{1} must
  cross each other, as a consequence of area preservation. How do we see
  this? Typically, there is a lower boundary or upper boundary in
  /J/_{0} for the evolution. In some situations, we have such a lower
  boundary because /J/_{0} cannot be negative. For example, in
  action-angle variables for motion near an elliptic fixed point we will
  see <<p320>>that the action is the area enclosed on the phase plane,
  which cannot be negative. For other situations, we might use the fact
  that there are invariant curves for large positive or negative
  /J/_{0}. In any case, suppose there is such a barrier /B/. Then the
  area of the region between the barrier and /C/_{0} must be equal to
  the area of the image of this region, which is the region between the
  barrier and /C/_{1}. So if /C/_{0} and /C/_{1} are not the same curve
  they must cross to contain the same area. In fact, they must cross an
  even number of times: they are both periodic, so if they cross once
  they must cross again to get back to the same side they started on.
  The points at which the curves /C/_{0} and /C/_{1} cross are fixed
  points because the angle does not change (that is what it means to be
  on /C/_{0}) and the action does not change (that is what it means for
  /C/_{0} and /C/_{1} to be the same at this point). So we have deduced
  that there must be an even number of fixed points of

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  . For each fixed point of

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  there are /k/ images of this fixed point generated on the surface of
  section for the map /T_{ϵ}/. Each of these image points is a periodic
  point of the map /T_{ϵ}/.

  #+caption: *Figure 4.15* The fixed point on the left is linearly
  unstable. The one on the right is linearly stable.
  [[file:images/Art_P873.jpg]]

  We can deduce the stability of these fixed points of

  $T_{\mathit{\epsilon}}^{k}$

  just from the construction. The fixed points come in two types,
  elliptic and hyperbolic. An elliptic (stable) fixed point appears
  where the steps from /C/_{0} to /C/_{1} join with the flow of the
  background twist map to encircle the fixed point. A hyperbolic
  (unstable) fixed point appears where the steps from /C/_{0} to /C/_{1}
  join with the flow of the background twist map to move away from the
  fixed point. So just from the way the arrows connect we can determine
  the character of the fixed point. See
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-15][figure 4.15]].

  As we develop a Poincaré section, we find that some orbits leave
  traces that circulate around the stable fixed points, resulting in the
  <<p321>>Poincaré--Birkhoff islands. If we look at a particular island
  we see that orbits in the island circulate around the fixed point at a
  rate that is monotonically dependent upon the distance from the fixed
  point. In the vicinity of the fixed point the evolution is governed by
  a twist map. So the entire Poincaré--Birkhoff construction can be
  carried out again. We expect that there will be concentric families of
  stable periodic points surrounded by islands and separated by
  separatrices emanating from unstable periodic points. Around each of
  these stable periodic orbits, the construction is repeated. So the
  Poincaré--Birkhoff construction is recursive, leading to the
  development of an infinite hierarchy of structure.

  There are so many conditions in our construction of the fixed points
  that one might be suspicious. We can make the construction more
  convincing by actually computing the various pieces for a specific
  problem. Consider the periodically driven rotor, with Hamiltonian
  ([[file:chapter004.html#disp_4.41][4.41]]). We set /m/ = 1 kg, /l/ = 1
  m, /A/ = 0.1 m,

  $\omega = 4.2\sqrt{9.8}\,\text{rad}\,\text{s}^{- 1}$

  .

  We call points that map to the same angle “radially mapping points.”
  We find them with a simple bisection search:

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (radially-mapping-points Tmap Jmin Jmax
  phi eps) (bisect (lambda (J) ((principal-value pi) (Tmap phi J (lambda
  (phip Jp) (- phi phip)) (lambda () (error "should not get here")))))
  Jmin Jmax eps)) {% endhighlight %}

  The procedure Tmap implements some map, which may be an iterate of
  some more primitive map. We give the procedure an angle phi to study,
  a range of actions Jmin to Jmax to search, and a tolerance eps for the
  solution.

  In [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-16][figure 4.16]] we show the
  Poincaré--Birkhoff construction of the fixed points for the driven
  rotor. These particular curves are constructed for the two 1:1
  commensurabilities between the rotation and the drive. One set of
  fixed points is constructed for each sense of rotation. The
  corresponding section is in [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-17][figure
  4.17]]. We see that the section shows the existence of fixed points
  exactly where the Poincaré--Birkhoff construction shows the crossing
  of the curves /C/_{0} and /C/_{1}. Indeed, the nature of the fixed
  point is <<p322>>clearly reflected in the relative configuration of
  the /C/_{0} and /C/_{1} curves.

  In [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-18][figure 4.18]] we show the result
  for a rotation number of 1/3. The curves are the radially mapping
  points for the third iterate of the section map (solid) and the images
  of these points (dotted). These curves are distorted by their
  proximity to the 1:1 islands shown in
  [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-17][figure 4.17]]. The corresponding
  section is shown in [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-19][figure 4.19]].

  * *4.6 Invariant Curves*
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h1-26b
    :CLASS: level1
    :END:
  We started with an integrable system, where there are invariant
  curves. Do any invariant curves survive if a perturbation is added?

  The Poincaré--Birkhoff construction for twist maps shows that
  invariant curves with rational rotation number typically do not
  survive perturbation. Upon perturbation the invariant curves with
  rational rotation numbers are replaced by an alternating sequence of
  stable and unstable periodic orbits. So if there are invariant curves
  that survive perturbation they must have irrational rotation numbers.

  The perturbed system has chains of alternating stable and unstable
  fixed points for every rational rotation number. Each stable fixed
  point is surrounded by an island that occupies some region of the
  section. Each irrational is arbitrarily close to a rational, so it is
  not obvious that any invariant curve can survive an arbitrarily small
  perturbation.

  Nevertheless, the Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser (KAM) theorem proves that
  invariant curves do exist if the perturbation is small enough that the
  perturbed problem is “close enough” to an integrable problem, and if
  the rotation number is “irrational enough.” We will not prove this
  theorem here. Instead we will develop methods for finding particular
  invariant curves.

  Stable periodic orbits have a stable island surrounding them on the
  surface of section. The largest islands are associated with rationals
  with small denominators. In general, the size of the island is limited
  to a size that decreases as the denominator increases. These islands
  are a local indication of the effect of the perturbation. Similarly,
  the chaotic zones appear near unstable periodic orbits and their
  homoclinic tangles. The homoclinic tangle is a continuous curve so it
  cannot cross an invariant curve, which is also continuous. If we are
  looking for invariant curves that persist upon perturbation, we would
  be wise to avoid regions of phase space where the islands or
  homoclinic tangles are major features.

  <<p325>>

  The Poincaré--Birkhoff islands are ordered by rotation number. Because
  of the twist condition, the rotation number is monotonic in the
  momentum of the unperturbed problem. If there is an invariant curve
  with a given rotation number, it is sandwiched between island chains
  associated with rational rotation numbers. The rotation number of the
  invariant curve must be between the rotation numbers of the island
  chains on either side of it.

  The fact that the size of the islands decreases with the size of the
  denominator suggests that invariant curves with rotation numbers for
  which nearby rationals require large denominators are the most likely
  to exist. So we will begin our search for invariant curves by
  examining rotation numbers that are not near rationals with small
  denominators.

  Any irrational can be approximated by a sequence of rationals, and for
  each of these rationals we expect there to be stable and unstable
  periodic orbits with stable islands and homoclinic tangles. An
  invariant curve for a given rotation number has the best chance of
  surviving if the size of the islands associated with each rational
  approximation to the rotation number is smaller than the separation of
  the islands from that invariant curve.

  For any particular size denominator, the best rational approximation
  to an irrational number is given by an initial segment of a simple
  continued fraction. If the approximating continued fraction converges
  slowly to the irrational number, then that number is not near
  rationals with small denominators. Thus, we will look for invariant
  curves with rotation numbers that have slowly converging
  continued-fraction approximations. The continued fractions that
  converge most slowly have tails that are all one. Such a number is
  called a /golden number/. For example, the golden ratio,

  $$\begin{matrix}
  {\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{1 + \cdots}}},} & {(4.43)} \\
  \end{matrix}$$

  is just such a number.

      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: h3_4-6-1
      :CLASS: level3
      :END:
  Invariant curves, if there are any, are characterized by a particular
  rotation number. Points on the invariant curve map to points on the
  invariant curve. Neighboring points map to neighboring points,
  preserving the order.

  On the section for the unperturbed integrable system, the angle
  between successive section points is constant: Δ/θ/ = 2/πν/(/J/) for
  rotation number /ν/(/J/). This map of the circle onto itself with
  constant angular step we call a /uniform circle map/.

  For a given rotation number, points on the section are laid down in a
  particular order characteristic of the rotation number only. As a
  perturbation is turned on, the invariant curve with a particular
  rotation number will be distorted and the angle between successive
  points will no longer be constant. All that is required to have a
  particular rotation number is that the average change in angle be
  Δ/θ/. Nevertheless, the ordering of the points on the surface of
  section is preserved, and is characteristic of the rotation number.

  The fact that the sequence of points on the surface of section for an
  invariant curve with a given rotation number must have a particular
  order can be used to find the invariant curve. At a specified angle we
  perform a bisection search for the momentum that lies on the invariant
  curve. We can tell whether the initial point is on the desired
  invariant curve or which side of the invariant curve it is on by
  evolving a candidate initial point with both the perturbed map and the
  uniform circle map and comparing the ordering of the sequences of
  points that are generated.

  A program to implement this plan of attack is^{[[#endnote_15][15]]}

  {% highlight scheme %} (define (find-invariant-curve the-map rn theta0

  Since ordering inconsistencies are found near the initial angle we do
  not need to keep the whole list of angles. Instead, we can keep track
  of a small list of angles near the initial angle. In fact, keeping
  <<p327>>track of the nearest angle on either side of the initial angle
  works well.

  The procedure which-way? is implemented as a simple loop with state
  variables for the two orbits and the endpoints of the intervals. The z
  variables keep track of the angle of the uniform circle map; the x
  variables keep track of the angle of the map under study. The y
  variable is the momentum for the map under study. On each iteration we
  determine if the angle of the uniform circle map is in the interval of
  interest below or above the initial angle. If it is in neither
  interval then the map is further iterated. However, if it is in the
  region of interest then we check to see if the angle of the other map
  is in the corresponding interval. If so, the intervals for the uniform
  circle map and the other map are narrowed and the iteration proceeds.
  If the angle is not in the required interval, a discrepancy is noted
  and the sign of the discrepancy is reported. For this process to make
  sense the differences between the angles for successive iterations of
  both maps must be less than /π/.

  With this method of comparing rotation numbers we can find the initial
  momentum (for a given initial angle) for an invariant curve with a
  given rotation number to high precision.

  Using initial conditions computed in this way, we can produce the
  invariant curve (see [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-20][figure 4.20]]).
  If we expand the putative <<p329>>invariant curve it should remain a
  curve for all magnifications---it should show no sign of chaotic
  fuzziness (see [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-21][figure 4.21]]).

  points appear to lie on a line. We also see that the visitation
  frequency of points is highly nonuniform.

  As can be seen in [[file:chapter004.html#Fig_4-21][figure 4.21]], the
  points on an invariant curve are not uniformly visited, unlike the
  picture we would get plotting the angles for the uniform circle map.
  This is because an interval may be expanded or compressed when mapped.
  We can compute the relative probability density for visitation of each
  angle on the invariant curve. A crude way to obtain this result is to
  count the number of points that fall into equal incremental angle
  bins. It is more effective to use the linear variational map
  constructed from the map being investigated to compute the change in
  incremental <<p330>>angle from one point to its successor. Since all
  of the points in a small interval around the source point are mapped
  to points (in the same order) in a small interval around the target
  point, the relative probability density at a point is inversely
  proportional to the size of the incremental interval around that
  point. In order to get this started we need a good estimate of the
  initial slope for the invariant curve. We can estimate the slope by a
  difference quotient of the momentum and angle increments for the
  interval that we used to refine the momentum of the invariant curve
  with a given rotation number.

  [[#Fig_4-22][Figures 4.22]] and [[#Fig_4-23][4.23]] show the relative
  probability density of visitation as a function of angle for the
  invariant curve of golden rotation number in the standard map for
  three different values of the parameter /K/. As /K/ increases, certain
  angles become less likely. Near /K/ = 0.971635406 some angles are
  never visited. But the invariant curve must be continuous. Thus it
  appears that for larger /K/ the invariant curve with this rotation
  number will not exist. Indeed, if the invariant set persists with the
  given rotation number it will have an infinite number of holes
  (because it has an irrational rotation number). Such a set is
  sometimes called a /cantorus/ (plural /cantori/).

  Surfaces of section of a typical Hamiltonian system exhibit a
  menagerie of features including fixed points, invariant curves,
  resonance islands, and chaotic zones. Integrable systems have much
  simpler surfaces of section. By adding small effects to integrable
  systems we get insight into how this complicated behavior emerges.

  Surfaces of section for integrable systems display only certain
  characteristic orbit types. There are fixed points, which correspond
  to equilibria or periodic orbits. A fixed point may be stable or
  unstable, depending on the stability of the corresponding equilibrium
  or orbit. There are sets of points on the section that are asymptotic
  forward and backward in time to the unstable fixed point. And there
  are sets of trajectories that fall on invariant curves. If the
  rotation number of the invariant curve is irrational, each of these
  trajectories densely covers the invariant curve; if the rotation
  number is rational, then each trajectory visits only a finite number
  of points on the invariant curve.

  visitation as a function of angle for the invariant curve of golden
  rotation number in the standard map with /K/ = 0.95 (above) and /K/ =

  certain angles become less likely to be visited.

  function is very complex and appears self-similar. The valleys appear
  to reach to zero, so there are discrete angles that are never visited.

  Linear stability analysis addresses the nature of the motion near the
  fixed points on the section. These points correspond to either
  equilibrium points or periodic orbits. There are characteristic
  frequencies of the motion, each with an associated characteristic
  direction. For Hamiltonian systems only certain patterns of
  characteristic frequencies are possible. On two-dimensional
  area-preserving surfaces of section, as generated by Hamiltonian
  systems, fixed points are linearly stable (elliptic fixed points) or
  linearly unstable (hyperbolic fixed points).

  With the addition of small effects, the surface of section changes in
  certain typical ways. One characteristic change occurs near the
  unstable fixed points. The stable and unstable manifolds, those curves
  consisting of the sets of points that are asymptotic to the unstable
  fixed points forward and backward in time, no longer join smoothly,
  but instead cross. A first crossing implies that there are an infinite
  number of other crossings, and the stable and unstable manifolds
  develop an extremely complicated tangle.

  <<p333>>

  The Poincaré--Birkhoff construction shows how the infinite number of
  periodic orbits on an invariant curve with rational rotation number
  that is characteristic of an integrable system degenerates into a
  finite number of alternating stable and unstable fixed points when the
  system becomes nonintegrable. This phenomenon is recursive, so we find
  that it develops an infinite hierarchy of structure: The region around
  every stable fixed point is itself filled with commensurabilities with
  alternating stable and unstable fixed points.

  Some invariant curves survive the addition of small effects to an
  integrable system. The Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theorem proves that
  some invariant curves persist upon perturbation. We can find invariant
  curves of particular rotation numbers by comparing the pattern of
  points generated for a candidate initial point on the invariant curve
  to the expected pattern of points for the invariant curve being
  sought. As the additional effect is made stronger, the invariant
  curves that survive longest are those with the most irrational
  rotation number. At the point of breakup, the probability of
  visitation of various points on the invariant curve develops a
  self-similar appearance. For larger perturbations, the invariant curve
  disappears, leaving an invariant set with an infinite number of holes.

  ([[file:chapter004.html#h1-24a][section 4.1]]) we see a chain of six
  secondary islands in the oscillation region. Carry out the

  *Exercise 4.10: Invariant curves of the standard map*

  *a.* Make programs that reproduce [[#Fig_4-22][figures 4.22]] and
  [[#Fig_4-23][4.23]]. You will need to develop an effective method of
  estimating the probability of visitation. There is one suggestion of
  how to do that in the text, but you may find a better way.

  *b.* As the parameter /K/ is increased beyond the critical value, the
  golden invariant curve ceases to exist. Investigate how the method for
  finding invariant curves fails beyond the critical value of /K/.

  [[#endnote_ref_1][^{1}]]Keep in mind that the abscissa is an angle.

  [[#endnote_ref_2][^{2}]]Actually, all we need is ∂_{0}∂_{1}/F/ (/t/,
  /z_{e}/) = 0.

  [[#endnote_ref_3][^{3}]]If the eigenvalues are not distinct then the
  form of the solution is modified.

  [[#endnote_ref_4][^{4}]]The map /T/ is being used as an operator:
  multiplication is interpreted as composition.

  [[#endnote_ref_5][^{5}]]A characteristic multiplier is also sometimes
  called a Floquet multiplier.

  [[#endnote_ref_6][^{6}]]We assume for now that the eigenvalues are
  distinct.

  [[#endnote_ref_7][^{7}]]Sometimes it is argued that the stable and
  unstable manifolds cannot cross themselves on the basis of the
  uniqueness of solutions of differential equations. This argument is
  incorrect. The stable and unstable manifolds are not themselves
  solutions of a differential equation, they are sets of points whose
  solutions are asymptotic to the unstable fixed points.

  [[#endnote_ref_8][^{8}]]The procedure iterated-map takes a map and an
  integer n. It returns a new map that is the result of iterating the
  given map n times.

  [[#endnote_ref_9][^{9}]]A commensurability occurs when the frequencies
  involved are not linearly independent over the integers. We will
  define this carefully on [[file:chapter004.html#p312][page 312]].

  [[#endnote_ref_10][^{10}]]Motion with /n/ incommensurate frequencies
  is dense on the /n/-torus. Furthermore, such motion is /ergodic/ on
  the /n/-torus. This means that time averages of time-independent
  phase-space functions computed along trajectories are equal to the
  phase-space average of the same function over the torus.

  [[#endnote_ref_11][^{11}]]For time-independent systems with two
  degrees of freedom the boundary between regions described by different
  action-angle coordinates has asymptotic solutions and unstable
  periodic orbits or equilibrium points. The solutions on the boundary
  are not described by the action-angle Hamiltonian.

  [[#endnote_ref_12][^{12}]]The coordinate

  $\widehat{\theta}\left( i \right)$

  is an angle. It can be brought to a standard interval such as 0 to
  2/π/.

  [[#endnote_ref_13][^{13}]]For a map to be a twist map we require that
  there is a positive number /K/ such that |/Dν/(/J/)| > /K/ > 0 over
  some interval of /J/.

  [[#endnote_ref_14][^{14}]]The section points for any particular orbit
  are countable and dense, but they have zero measure on the line.

  [[#endnote_ref_15][^{15}]]This method depends on the assumptions that
  Jmin and Jmax bracket the actual momentum, and that the rotation
  number is sufficiently continuous in momentum in that region.

  [[#endnote_ref_16][^{16}]]There is no invariant curve in the standard
  map that has rotation number /ϕ/ = 1.618.... However, 1 − 1//ϕ/ has
  the same continued-fraction tail as /ϕ/ and this rotation number
  appears in the standard map.
