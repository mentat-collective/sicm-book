The purpose of mechanics is to describe how bodies change their position in
space with “time.” I should load my conscience with grave sins against the
sacred spirit of lucidity were I to formulate the aims of mechanics in this way,
without serious reflection and detailed explanations. Let us proceed to disclose
these sins.

The subject of this book is motion and the mathematical tools used to describe
it.

Centuries of careful observations of the motions of the planets revealed
regularities in those motions, allowing accurate predictions of phenomena such
as eclipses and conjunctions. The effort to formulate these regularities and
ultimately to understand them led to the development of mathematics and to the
discovery that mathematics could be effectively used to describe aspects of the
physical world. That mathematics can be used to describe natural phenomena is a
remarkable fact.

A pin thrown by a juggler takes a rather predictable path and rotates in a
rather predictable way. In fact, the skill of juggling depends crucially on this
predictability. It is also a remarkable discovery that the same mathematical
tools used to describe the motions of the planets can be used to describe the
motion of the juggling pin.

Classical mechanics describes the motion of a system of particles, subject to
forces describing their interactions. Complex physical objects, such as juggling
pins, can be modeled as myriad particles with fixed spatial relationships
maintained by stiff forces of interaction.

There are many conceivable ways a system could move that never occur. We can
imagine that the juggling pin might pause in midair or go fourteen times around
the head of the juggler before being caught, but these motions do not happen.
How can we distinguish motions of a system that can actually occur from other
conceivable motions? Perhaps we can invent some mathematical function that
allows us to distinguish realizable motions from among all conceivable motions.

The motion of a system can be described by giving the position of every piece of
the system at each moment. Such a description of the motion of the system is
called a /configuration path/; the configuration path specifies the
configuration as a function of time. The juggling pin rotates as it flies
through the air; the configuration of the juggling pin is specified by giving
the position and orientation of the pin. The motion of the juggling pin is
specified by giving the position and orientation of the pin as a function of
time.

The path-distinguishing function that we seek takes a configuration path as an
input and produces some output. We want this function to have some
characteristic behavior when its input is a realizable path. For example, the
output could be a number, and we could try to arrange that this number be zero
only on realizable paths. Newton's equations of motion are of this form; at each
moment Newton's differential equations must be satisfied.

However, there is an alternate strategy that provides more insight and power: we
could look for a path-distinguishing function that has a minimum on the
realizable paths---on nearby unrealizable paths the value of the function is
higher than it is on the realizable path. This is the /variational strategy/:
for each physical system we invent a path-distinguishing function that
distinguishes realizable motions of the system by having a stationary point for
each realizable path[fn:1]. For a great variety of systems realizable motions of
the system can be formulated in terms of a variational principle.[fn:2]

Mechanics, as invented by Newton and others of his era, describes the motion of
a system in terms of the positions, velocities, and accelerations of each of the
particles in the system. In contrast to the Newtonian formulation of mechanics,
the variational formulation of mechanics describes the motion of a system in
terms of aggregate quantities that are associated with the motion of the system
as a whole.

In the Newtonian formulation the forces can often be written as derivatives of
the potential energy of the system. The motion of the system is determined by
considering how the individual component particles respond to these forces. The
Newtonian formulation of the equations of motion is intrinsically a
particle-by-particle description.

In the variational formulation the equations of motion are formulated in terms
of the difference of the kinetic energy and the potential energy. The potential
energy is a number that is characteristic of the arrangement of the particles in
the system; the kinetic energy is a number that is determined by the velocities
of the particles in the system. Neither the potential energy nor the kinetic
energy depends on how those positions and velocities are specified. The
difference is characteristic of the system as a whole and does not depend on the
details of how the system is specified. So we are free to choose ways of
describing the system that are easy to work with; we are liberated from the
particle-by-particle description inherent in the Newtonian formulation.

The variational formulation has numerous advantages over the Newtonian
formulation. The equations of motion for those parameters that describe the
state of the system are derived in the same way regardless of the choice of
those parameters: the method of formulation does not depend on the choice of
coordinate system. If there are positional constraints among the particles of a
system the Newtonian formulation requires that we consider the forces
maintaining these constraints, whereas in the variational formulation the
constraints can be built into the coordinates. The variational formulation
reveals the association of conservation laws with symmetries. The variational
formulation provides a framework for placing any particular motion of a system
in the context of all possible motions of the system. We pursue the variational
formulation because of these advantages.

* 1.1 Configuration Spaces
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:

  Let us consider mechanical systems that can be thought of as composed of
  constituent point particles, with mass and position, but with no internal
  structure.[fn:3] Extended bodies may be thought of as composed of a large
  number of these constituent particles with specific spatial relationships
  among them. Extended bodies maintain their shape because of spatial
  constraints among the constituent particles. Specifying the position of all
  the constituent particles of a system specifies the /configuration/ of the
  system. The existence of constraints among parts of the system, such as those
  that determine the shape of an extended body, means that the constituent
  particles cannot assume all possible positions. The set of all configurations
  of the system that can be assumed is called the /configuration space/ of the
  system. The /dimension/ of the configuration space is the smallest number of
  parameters that have to be given to completely specify a configuration. The
  dimension of the configuration space is also called the number of /degrees of
  freedom/ of the system.[fn:4]

  For a single unconstrained particle it takes three parameters to specify the
  configuration; a point particle has a three-dimensional configuration space.
  If we are dealing with a system with more than one point particle, the
  configuration space is more complicated. If there are /k/ separate particles
  we need 3/k/ parameters to describe the possible configurations. If there are
  constraints among the parts of a system the configuration is restricted to a
  lower-dimensional space. For example, a system consisting of two point
  particles constrained to move in three dimensions so that the distance between
  the particles remains fixed has a five-dimensional configuration space: thus
  with three numbers we can fix the position of one particle, and with two
  others we can give the position of the other particle relative to the first.

  Consider a juggling pin. The configuration of the pin is specified if we give
  the positions of the atoms making up the pin. However, there exist more
  economical descriptions of the configuration. In the idealization that the
  juggling pin is truly rigid, the distances among all the atoms of the pin
  remain constant. So we can specify the configuration of the pin by giving the
  position of a single atom and the orientation of the pin. Using the
  constraints, the positions of all the other constituents of the pin can be
  determined from this information. The dimension of the configuration space of
  the juggling pin is six: the minimum number of parameters that specify the
  position in space is three, and the minimum number of parameters that specify
  an orientation is also three.

  As a system evolves with time, the constituent particles move subject to the
  constraints. The motion of each constituent particle is specified by
  describing the changing configuration. Thus, the motion of the system may be
  described as evolving along a path in configuration space. The configuration
  path may be specified by a function, the configuration-path function, which
  gives the configuration of the system at any time.

*** Exercise 1.1: Degrees of freedom

    For each of the mechanical systems described below, give the number of
    degrees of freedom of the configuration space.

    - *a.* Three juggling pins.

    - *b.* A spherical pendulum, consisting of a point mass (the pendulum bob)
    hanging from a rigid massless rod attached to a fixed support point. The
    pendulum bob may move in any direction subject to the constraint imposed by
    the rigid rod. The point mass is subject to the uniform force of gravity.

    - *c.* A spherical double pendulum, consisting of one point mass hanging
      from a rigid massless rod attached to a second point mass hanging from a second
    massless rod attached to a fixed support point. The point masses are subject
    to the uniform force of gravity.

    - *d.* A point mass sliding without friction on a rigid curved wire.

    - *e.* A top consisting of a rigid axisymmetric body with one point on the
    symmetry axis of the body attached to a fixed support, subject to a uniform
    gravitational force.

    - *f.* The same as *e*, but not axisymmetric.

* 1.2 Generalized Coordinates
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-3
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:

  In order to be able to talk about specific configurations we need to have a
  set of parameters that label the configurations. The parameters used to
  specify the configuration of the system are called the /generalized
  coordinates/. Consider an unconstrained free particle. The configuration of
  the particle is specified by giving its position. This requires three
  parameters. The unconstrained particle has three degrees of freedom. One way
  to specify the position of a particle is to specify its rectangular
  coordinates relative to some chosen coordinate axes. The rectangular
  components of the position are generalized coordinates for an unconstrained
  particle. Or consider an ideal planar double pendulum: a point mass
  constrained to be a given distance from a fixed point by a rigid rod, with a
  second mass constrained to be at a given distance from the first mass by
  another rigid rod, all confined to a vertical plane. The configuration is
  specified if the orientation of the two rods is given. This requires at least
  two parameters; the planar double pendulum has two degrees of freedom. One way
  to specify the orientation of each rod is to specify the angle it makes with a
  vertical plumb line. These two angles are generalized coordinates for the
  planar double pendulum.

  The number of coordinates need not be the same as the dimension of the
  configuration space, though there must be at least that many. We may choose to
  work with more parameters than necessary, but then the parameters will be
  subject to constraints that restrict the system to possible configurations,
  that is, to elements of the configuration space.

  For the planar double pendulum described above, the two angle coordinates are
  enough to specify the configuration. We could also take as generalized
  coordinates the rectangular coordinates of each of the masses in the plane,
  relative to some chosen coordinate axes. These are also fine coordinates, but
  we would have to explicitly keep in mind the constraints that limit the
  possible configurations to the actual geometry of the system. Sets of
  coordinates with the same dimension as the configuration space are easier to
  work with because we do not have to deal with explicit constraints among the
  coordinates. So for the time being we will consider only formulations where
  the number of configuration coordinates is equal to the number of degrees of
  freedom; later we will learn how to handle systems with redundant coordinates
  and explicit constraints.

  In general, the configurations form a space $M$ of some dimension $n$. The
  $n$-dimensional configuration space can be parameterized by choosing a
  coordinate function $\chi$ that maps elements of the configuration space to
  $n$-tuples of real numbers.[fn:5] If there is more than one dimension, the
  function $\chi$ is a tuple of $n$ independent coordinate functions[fn:6]
  /χ^{i}, i/ = 0, ..., /n/ − 1, where each /χ^{i}/ is a real-valued function
  defined on some region of the configuration space.[fn:7] For a given
  configuration /m/ in the configuration space /M/ the values /χ^{i}/(/m/) of
  the coordinate functions are the generalized coordinates of the configuration.
  These generalized coordinates permit us to identify points of the
  /n/-dimensional configuration space with /n/-tuples of real numbers.[fn:8] For
  any given configuration space, there are a great variety of ways to choose
  generalized coordinates. Even for a single point moving without constraints,
  we can choose rectangular coordinates, polar coordinates, or any other
  coordinate system that strikes our fancy.

  The motion of the system can be described by a configuration path /γ/ mapping
  time to configuration-space points. Corresponding to the configuration path is
  a /coordinate path/ $q = $\chi \circ \gamma$ mapping time to tuples of
  generalized coordinates.[fn:9] If there is more than one degree of freedom the
  coordinate path is a structured object: $q$ is a tuple of component coordinate
  path functions $q^i = \chi^i \circ \gamma$. At each instant of time $t$, the
  values $q(t) = \left(q^0(t),\, \ldots,\, q^{n−1}(t) \right)$ are the
  generalized coordinates of a configuration.

  The derivative $Dq$ of the coordinate path $q$ is a function[fn:10] that gives
  the rate of change of the configuration coordinates at a given time: /Dq/(/t/)
  = (/Dq/^{0}(/t/), ..., /Dq/^{/n/−1}(/t/)). The rate of change of a generalized
  coordinate is called a /generalized velocity/.

*** Exercise 1.2: Generalized coordinates

    For each of the systems in [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-1][exercise 1.1]], specify a system of generalized
    coordinates that can be used to describe the behavior of the system.

* 1.3 The Principle of Stationary Action
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-4
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:

  Let us suppose that for each physical system there is a path-distinguishing
  function that is stationary on realizable paths. We will try to deduce some of
  its properties.

** Experience of motion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: experience-of-motion
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:

   Our ordinary experience suggests that physical motion can be described by
   configuration paths that are continuous and smooth.[fn:11] We do not see the
   juggling pin jump from one place to another. Nor do we see the juggling pin
   suddenly change the way it is moving.

   Our ordinary experience suggests that the motion of physical systems does not
   depend upon the entire history of the system. If we enter the room after the
   juggling pin has been thrown into the air we cannot tell when it left the
   juggler's hand. The juggler could have thrown the pin from a variety of
   places at a variety of times with the same apparent result as we walk through
   the door.[fn:12] So the motion of the pin does not depend on the details of
   the history.

   Our ordinary experience suggests that the motion of physical systems is
   deterministic. In fact, a small number of parameters summarize the important
   aspects of the history of the system and determine its future evolution. For
   example, at any moment the position, velocity, orientation, and rate of
   change of the orientation of the juggling pin are enough to completely
   determine the future motion of the pin.

** Realizable paths
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: realizable-paths
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:

   From our experience of motion we develop certain expectations about
   realizable configuration paths. If a path is realizable, then any segment of
   the path is a realizable path segment. Conversely, a path is realizable if
   every segment of the path is a realizable path segment. The realizability of
   a path segment depends on all points of the path in the segment. The
   realizability of a path segment depends on every point of the path segment in
   the same way; no part of the path is special. The realizability of a path
   segment depends only on points of the path within the segment; the
   realizability of a path segment is a local property.

   So the path-distinguishing function aggregates some local property of the
   system measured at each moment along the path segment. Each moment along the
   path must be treated in the same way. The contributions from each moment
   along the path segment must be combined in a way that maintains the
   independence of the contributions from disjoint subsegments. One method of
   combination that satisfies these requirements is to add up the contributions,
   making the path-distinguishing function an integral over the path segment of
   some local property of the path.[fn:13]

   So we will try to arrange that the path-distinguishing function, constructed
   as an integral of a local property along the path, assumes a stationary value
   for any realizable path. Such a path-distinguishing function is traditionally
   called an /action/ for the system. We use the word “action” to be consistent
   with common usage. Perhaps it would be clearer to continue to call it
   “path-distinguishing function,” but then it would be more difficult for
   others to know what we were talking about.[fn:14]

   In order to pursue the agenda of variational mechanics, we must invent action
   functions that are stationary on the realizable trajectories of the systems
   we are studying. We will consider actions that are integrals of some local
   property of the configuration path at each moment. Let /q/ = /χ/ ∘ /γ/ be a
   coordinate path in the configuration space; /q/(/t/) are the coordinates of
   the configuration at time /t/. Then the action of a segment of the path in
   the time interval from /t/_{1} to /t/_{2} is[fn:15]

   \begin{equation}
   {S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{F\lbrack q\rbrack.}}} & {(1.1)}
   \end{equation}

   where /F/[/q/] is a function of time that measures some local property of the
   path. It may depend upon the value of the function /q/ at that time and the
   value of any derivatives of /q/ at that time.[fn:16]

   The configuration path can be locally described at a moment in terms of the
   coordinates, the rate of change of the coordinates, and all the higher
   derivatives of the coordinates at the given moment. Given this information
   the path can be reconstructed in some interval containing that moment.[fn:17]
   Local properties of paths can depend on no more than the local description of
   the path.

   The function /F/ measures some local property of the coordinate path /q/. We
   can decompose /F/ [/q/] into two parts: a part that measures some property of
   a local description and a part that extracts a local description of the path
   from the path function. The function that measures the local property of the
   system depends on the particular physical system; the method of construction
   of a local description of a path from a path is the same for any system. We
   can write /F/[/q/] as a composition of these two functions:[fn:18]

   \begin{equation}
   {F\lbrack q\rbrack = L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.2)}
   \end{equation}

   The function Γ takes the coordinate path and produces a function of time
   whose value is an ordered tuple containing the time, the coordinates at that
   time, the rate of change of the coordinates at that time, and the values of
   higher derivatives of the coordinates evaluated at that time. For the path
   /q/ and time /t/:

   \begin{equation}
   {\Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack(t) = (t,q(t),Dq(t),\ldots).} & {(1.3)}
   \end{equation}

   We refer to this tuple, which includes as many derivatives as are needed, as
   the /local tuple/. The function Γ[/q/] depends only on the coordinate path
   /q/ and its derivatives; the function Γ[/q/] does not depend on /χ/ or the
   fact that /q/ is made by composing /χ/ with /γ/.

   The function /L/ depends on the specific details of the physical system being
   investigated, but does not depend on any particular configuration path. The
   function /L/ computes a real-valued local property of the path. We will find
   that /L/ needs only a finite number of components of the local tuple to
   compute this property: The path can be locally reconstructed from the full
   local description; that /L/ depends on a finite number of components of the
   local tuple guarantees that it measures a local property.[fn:19]

   The advantage of this decomposition is that the local description of the path
   is computed by a uniform process from the configuration path, independent of
   the system being considered. All of the system-specific information is
   captured in the function /L/.

   The function /L/ is called a /Lagrangian/[fn:20] for the system, and the
   resulting action,

   \begin{equation}
   {S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack,}}} & {(1.4)}
   \end{equation}

   is called the /Lagrangian action/. For Lagrangians that depend only on time,
   positions, and velocities the action can also be written

   \begin{equation}
   {S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{L(t,q(t),Dq(t))\, dt.}}} & {(1.5)}
   \end{equation}

   Lagrangians can be found for a great variety of systems. We will see that for
   many systems the Lagrangian can be taken to be the difference between kinetic
   and potential energy. Such Lagrangians depend only on the time, the
   configuration, and the rate of change of the configuration. We will focus on
   this class of systems, but will also consider more general systems from time
   to time.

   A realizable path of the system is to be distinguished from others by having
   stationary action with respect to some set of nearby unrealizable paths. Now
   some paths near realizable paths will also be realizable: for any motion of
   the juggling pin there is another that is slightly different. So when
   addressing the question of whether the action is stationary with respect to
   variations of the path we must somehow restrict the set of paths we are
   considering to contain only one realizable path. It will turn out that for
   Lagrangians that depend only on the configuration and rate of change of
   configuration it is enough to restrict the set of paths to those that have
   the same configuration at the endpoints of the path segment.

   The /principle of stationary action/ asserts that for each dynamical system
   we can cook up a Lagrangian such that a realizable path connecting the
   configurations at two times /t/_{1} and /t/_{2} is distinguished from all
   conceivable paths by the fact that the action /S/[/q/](/t/_{1}, /t/_{2}) is
   stationary with respect to variations of the path.[fn:21] For Lagrangians
   that depend only on the configuration and rate of change of configuration,
   the variations are restricted to those that preserve the configurations at
   /t/_{1} and /t/_{2}.[fn:22]

*** Exercise 1.3: Fermat optics

    Fermat observed that the laws of reflection and refraction could be
    accounted for by the following facts: Light travels in a straight line in
    any particular medium with a velocity that depends upon the medium. The path
    taken by a ray from a source to a destination through any sequence of media
    is a path of least total time, compared to neighboring paths. Show that
    these facts imply the laws of reflection and refraction.[fn:23]

* 1.4 Computing Actions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-5
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:

  To illustrate the above ideas, and to introduce their formulation as computer
  programs, we consider the simplest mechanical system---a free particle moving
  in three dimensions. Euler and Lagrange discovered that for a free particle
  the time integral of the kinetic energy over the particle's actual path is
  smaller than the same integral along any alternative path between the same
  points: a free particle moves according to the principle of stationary action,
  provided we take the Lagrangian to be the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy
  for a particle of mass /m/ and velocity

  $\overset{\rightarrow}{v}$

  is

  $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

  , where /v/ is the magnitude of

  $\overset{\rightarrow}{v}$

  . In this case we can choose the generalized coordinates to be the ordinary
  rectangular coordinates.

  Following Euler and Lagrange, the Lagrangian for the free particle is[fn:24]

  \begin{equation}
  {L(t,x,v) = \frac{1}{2}m(v \cdot v),} & {(1.6)}
  \end{equation}

  where the formal parameter /x/ names a tuple of components of the position
  with respect to a given rectangular coordinate system, and the formal
  parameter /v/ names a tuple of velocity components.[fn:25]

  We can express this formula as a procedure:

  #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-free-particle mass) local)
  (let ((v (velocity local)))
    (* 1/2 mass (dot-product v v))))
  #+end_src

  The definition indicates that L-free-particle is a procedure that takes mass
  as an argument and returns a procedure that takes a local tuple local,
  extracts the generalized velocity with the procedure velocity, and uses the
  velocity to compute the value of the Lagrangian.[fn:26]

  Suppose we let /q/ denote a coordinate path function that maps time to
  position components:[fn:27]

  \begin{equation}
  {q(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t)).} & {(1.7)}
  \end{equation}

  We can make this definition[fn:28]

  #+begin_src scheme
(define q
  (up (literal-function 'x)
      (literal-function 'y)
      (literal-function 'z)))
  #+end_src

  where literal-function makes a procedure that represents a function of one
  argument that has no known properties other than the given symbolic name. The
  symbol q now names a procedure of one real argument (time) that produces a
  tuple of three components representing the coordinates at that time. For
  example, we can evaluate this procedure for a symbolic time t as follows:

  #+begin_src scheme
(q 't)
(up (x t) (y t) (z t))
  #+end_src

  The derivative of the coordinate path /Dq/ is the function that maps time to
  velocity components:

  $Dq(t) = (Dx(t),Dy(t),Dz(t)).$

  We can make and use the derivative of a function.[fn:29] For example, we can
  write:

  #+begin_src scheme
((D q) 't)
(up ((D x) t) ((D y) t) ((D z) t))
  #+end_src

  The function Γ takes a coordinate path and returns a function of time that
  gives the local tuple (/t, q/(/t/), /Dq/(/t/), ...). We implement this Γ with
  the procedure Gamma.[fn:30] Here is what Gamma does:

  #+begin_src scheme
((Gamma q) 't)

(up t (up (x t) (y t) (z t)) (up ((D x) t) ((D y) t) ((D z) t)))
  #+end_src

  So the composition /L/ ∘ Γ is a function of time that returns the value of the
  Lagrangian for this point on the path:[fn:31]

  #+begin_src scheme
((compose (L-free-particle 'm) (Gamma q)) 't)
(+ (* 1/2 m (expt ((D x) t) 2)) (* 1/2 m (expt ((D y) t) 2)) (* 1/2 m (expt ((D
z) t) 2)))
  #+end_src

  The procedure =show-expression= simplifies the expression and uses T_{E}X to
  display the result in traditional infix form. We use this method of display to
  make the boxed expressions in this book. The procedure show-expression also
  produces the prefix form, but we usually do not show this.[fn:32]

  #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression
 ((compose (L-free-particle 'm) (Gamma q)) 't))
  #+end_src

  #+begin_export latex
  \frac{1}{2}m\,\,{(Dx\,\,(t))}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m\,\,{(Dy\,\,(t))}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}m\,\,{(Dz\,\,(t))}^{2}
  #+end_export

  According to equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.4][1.4]]) we can compute the Lagrangian action from time
  /t/_{1} to time /t/_{2} as:

  #+begin_src scheme
(define (Lagrangian-action L q t1 t2)
  (definite-integral
    (compose L (Gamma q)) t1 t2))
  #+end_src

  Lagrangian-action takes as arguments a procedure L that computes the
  Lagrangian, a procedure q that computes a coordinate path, and starting and
  ending times t1 and t2. The definite-integral used here takes as arguments a
  function and two limits t1 and t2, and computes the definite integral of the
  function over the interval from t1 to t2.[fn:33] Notice that the definition of
  Lagrangian-action does not depend on any particular set of coordinates or even
  the dimension of the configuration space. The method of computing the action
  from the coordinate representation of a Lagrangian and a coordinate path does
  not depend on the coordinate system.

  We can now compute the action for the free particle along a path. For example,
  consider a particle moving at uniform speed along a straight line /t/ ↦
  (4/t/ + 7, 3/t/ + 5, 2/t/ + 1).[fn:34] We represent the path as a procedure

  #+begin_src scheme
(define (test-path t)
  (up (+ (* 4 t) 7)
      (+ (* 3 t) 5)
      (+ (* 2 t) 1)))
  #+end_src

  For a particle of mass 3, we obtain the action between /t/ = 0 and /t/ = 10
  as[fn:35]

  #+begin_src scheme

*** Exercise 1.4: Lagrangian actions

    For a free particle an appropriate Lagrangian is[fn:36]

    \begin{equation}
    {L(t,x,v) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}.} & {(1.8)}
    \end{equation}

    Suppose that /x/ is the constant-velocity straight-line path of a free
    particle, such that /x/_{/a/} = /x/(/t/_{/a/}) and /x/_{/b/} =
    /x/(/t/_{/b/}). Show that the action on the solution path is

    \begin{equation}
    {\frac{m}{2}\frac{{(x_{b} - x_{a})}^{2}}{t_{b} - t_{a}}.} & {(1.9)}
    \end{equation}

** Paths of minimum action
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: paths-of-minimum-action
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   We already know that the actual path of a free particle is uniform motion in
   a straight line. According to Euler and Lagrange, the action is smaller along
   a straight-line test path than along nearby paths. Let $q$ be a straight-line
   test path with action $S\left[q\right](t_1, t_2)$. Let $q + \varepsilon \eta$
   be a nearby path, obtained from $q$ by adding a path variation $\eta$ scaled
   by the real parameter $\varepsilon$.[fn:37] The action on the varied path is
   $S\left[q + \varepsilon \eta\right](t_1, t_2)$. Euler and Lagrange found that
   $S\left[q + \varepsilon \eta\right](t_1, t_2) > S\left[q\right](t_1, t_2)$
   for any $\eta$ that is zero at the endpoints and for any small nonzero
   $\eta$.

   Let's check this numerically by varying the test path, adding some amount of
   a test function that is zero at the endpoints $t = t_1$ and $t = t_2$. To
   make a function $\eta$ that is zero at the endpoints, given a sufficiently
   well-behaved function /ν/, we can use /η/(/t/) = (/t/ − /t/_{1})(/t/ −
   /t/_{2})/ν/(/t/). This can be implemented:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((make-eta nu t1 t2) t)
  (* (- t t1) (- t t2) (nu t)))
   #+end_src

   We can use this to compute the action for a free particle over a path varied
   from the given path, as a function of /ϵ/:[fn:38]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((varied-free-particle-action mass q nu t1 t2) eps)
  (let ((eta (make-eta nu t1 t2)))
    (Lagrangian-action (L-free-particle mass)
                       (+ q (* eps eta)) t1 t2)))
    #+end_src

   The action for the varied path, with /ν/(/t/) = (sin /t,/ cos /t/, /t/^{2})
   and /ϵ/ = 0.001, is, as expected, larger than for the test path:

    #+begin_src scheme
((varied-free-particle-action 3.0 test-path (up sin cos square) 0.0 10.0) 0.001)
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src scheme
436.29121428571153
    #+end_src

   We can numerically compute the value of /ϵ/ for which the action is
   minimized. We search between, say, −2 and 1:[fn:39]

    #+begin_src scheme
(minimize
 (varied-free-particle-action 3.0 test-path (up sin cos square) 0.0 10.0) -2.0
1.0)
    #+end_src

   #+begin_src scheme
(-1.5987211554602254e-14 435.0000000000237 5) {%
   #+end_src



   We find exactly what is expected---that the best value for /ϵ/ is
   zero,[fn:40] and the minimum value of the action is the action along the
   straight path.

** Finding trajectories that minimize the action
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: finding-trajectories-that-minimize-the-action
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   We have used the variational principle to determine if a given trajectory is
   realizable. We can also use the variational principle to find trajectories.
   Given a set of trajectories that are specified by a finite number of
   parameters, we can search the parameter space looking for the trajectory in
   the set that best approximates the real trajectory by finding one that
   minimizes the action. By choosing a good set of approximating functions we
   can get arbitrarily close to the real trajectory.[fn:41]

   One way to make a parametric path that has fixed endpoints is to use a
   polynomial that goes through the endpoints as well as a number of
   intermediate points. Variation of the positions of the intermediate points
   varies the path; the parameters of the varied path are the coordinates of the
   intermediate positions. The procedure make-path constructs such a path using
   a Lagrange interpolation polynomial. The procedure make-path is called with
   five arguments: (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 qs), where q0 and q1 are the
   endpoints, t0 and t1 are the corresponding times, and qs is a list of
   intermediate points.[fn:42]



   Having specified a parametric path, we can construct a parametric action that
   is just the action computed along the parametric path:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((parametric-path-action Lagrangian t0 q0 t1 q1) qs)
  (let ((path (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 qs)))
    (Lagrangian-action Lagrangian path t0 t1)))
    #+end_src

   We can find approximate solution paths by finding parameters that minimize
   the action. We do this minimization with a canned multidimensional
   minimization procedure:[fn:43]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (find-path Lagrangian t0 q0 t1 q1 n)
  (let ((initial-qs (linear-interpolants q0 q1 n)))
    (let ((minimizing-qs (multidimensional-minimize
                          (parametric-path-action Lagrangian t0 q0 t1 q1) initial-qs)))
      (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 minimizing-qs))))
    #+end_src

   The procedure multidimensional-minimize takes a procedure (in this case the
   value of the call to parametric-path-action) that computes the function to be
   minimized (in this case the action) and an initial guess for the parameters.
   Here we choose the initial guess to be equally spaced points on a straight
   line between the two endpoints, computed with linear-interpolants.

   To illustrate the use of this strategy, we will find trajectories of the
   harmonic oscillator, with Lagrangian[fn:44]

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t,q,v) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \frac{1}{2}kq^{2},} & {(1.10)}
   \end{equation}

   for mass /m/ and spring constant /k/. This Lagrangian is implemented
   by[fn:45]

   #+caption: *Figure 1.1* The difference between the polynomial
   approximation with minimum action and the actual trajectory taken by the
   harmonic oscillator. The abscissa is the time and the ordinate is the error.
   [[file:images/Art_P19.jpg]]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-harmonic m k) local)
  (let ((q (coordinate local))
        (v (velocity local)))
    (- (* 1/2 m (square v))
       (* 1/2 k (square q)))))
    #+end_src

   We can find an approximate path taken by the harmonic oscillator for /m/ = 1
   and /k/ = 1 between /q/(0) = 1 and /q/(/π//2) = 0 as follows:[fn:46]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define q
  (find-path (L-harmonic 1.0 1.0) 0.0 1.0 :pi/2 0.0 3))
    #+end_src

   We know that the trajectories of this harmonic oscillator, for /m/ = 1 and
   /k/ = 1, are

   \begin{equation}
   {q(t) = A\,\,\text{cos}(t + \varphi)} & {(1.11)}
   \end{equation}

   where the amplitude /A/ and the phase /φ/ are determined by the initial
   conditions. For the chosen endpoint conditions the solution is /q/(/t/) =
   cos(/t/). The approximate path should be an approximation to cosine over the
   range from 0 to /π//2. [[#Fig_1-1][Figure 1.1]] shows the error in the polynomial
   approximation produced by this process. The maximum error in the
   approximation with three intermediate points is less than 1.7 × 10^{−4}. We
   find, as expected, that the error in the approximation decreases as the
   number of intermediate points is increased. For four intermediate points it
   is about a factor of 15 better.

   *Exercise 1.5: Solution process*

   We can watch the progress of the minimization by modifying the procedure
   parametric-path-action to plot the path each time the action is computed. Try
   this:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define win2 (frame 0.0 :pi/2 0.0 1.2))

(define ((parametric-path-action Lagrangian t0 q0 t1 q1) intermediate-qs)
  (let ((path (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 intermediate-qs))) ;; display path
    (graphics-clear win2)
    (plot-function win2 path t0 t1 (/ (- t1 t0) 100)) ;; compute action
    (Lagrangian-action Lagrangian path t0 t1)))

(find-path (L-harmonic 1.0 1.0) 0.0 1.0 :pi/2 0.0 2)
    #+end_src

   *Exercise 1.6: Minimizing action*

   Suppose we try to obtain a path by minimizing an action for an impossible
   problem. For example, suppose we have a free particle and we impose endpoint
   conditions on the velocities as well as the positions that are inconsistent
   with the particle being free. Does the formalism protect itself from such an
   unpleasant attack? You may find it illuminating to program it and see what
   happens.

* 1.5 The Euler--Lagrange Equations
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  The principle of stationary action characterizes the realizable paths of
  systems in configuration space as those for which the action has a stationary
  value. In elementary calculus, we learn that the critical points of a function
  are the points where the derivative vanishes. In an analogous way, the paths
  along which the action is stationary are solutions of a system of differential
  equations. This system, called the /Euler--Lagrange equations/ or just the
  /Lagrange equations/, is the link that permits us to use the principle of
  stationary action to compute the motions of mechanical systems, and to relate
  the variational and Newtonian formulations of mechanics.



** Lagrange equations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: lagrange-equations
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   We will find that if /L/ is a Lagrangian for a system that depends on time,
   coordinates, and velocities, and if /q/ is a coordinate path for which the
   action /S/[/q/](/t/_{1}, /t/_{2}) is stationary (with respect to any
   variation in the path that keeps the endpoints of the path fixed), then

   \begin{equation}
   {D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - \partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = 0.} & {(1.12)}
   \end{equation}

   Here /L/ is a real-valued function of a local tuple; ∂_{1}/L/ and ∂_{2}/L/
   denote the partial derivatives of /L/ with respect to its generalized
   position argument and generalized velocity argument respectively.[fn:47] The
   function ∂_{2}/L/ maps a local tuple to a structure whose components are the
   derivatives of /L/ with respect to each component of the generalized
   velocity. The function Γ[/q/] maps time to the local tuple: Γ[/q/](/t/) =
   (/t/, /q/(/t/), /Dq/(/t/), ...). Thus the compositions ∂_{1}/L/ ∘ Γ[/q/] and
   ∂_{2}/L/ ∘ Γ[/q/] are functions of one argument, time. The Lagrange equations
   assert that the derivative of ∂_{2}/L/ ∘ Γ[/q/] is equal to ∂_{1}/L/ ∘
   Γ[/q/], at any time. Given a Lagrangian, the Lagrange equations form a system
   of ordinary differential equations that must be satisfied by realizable
   paths.

   Lagrange's equations are traditionally written as a separate equation for
   each component of /q/:

   $\begin{equation} {\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial
   L}{\partial{\overset{˙}{q}}^{i}} - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q^{i}} = 0} &
   {i = 0,\ldots,n - 1.} \end{equation}$

   In this way of writing Lagrange's equations the notation does not distinguish
   between /L/, which is a real-valued function of three variables (/t/, /q/,

   q˙

   ), and /L/ ∘ Γ[/q/], which is a real-valued function of one real variable
   /t/. If we do not realize this notational pun, the equations don't make sense
   as written---∂/L//∂

   q˙

   is a function of three variables, so we must regard the arguments /q,/ 

   q˙

   as functions of /t/ before taking /d///dt/ of the expression. Similarly,
   ∂/L//∂/q/ is a function of three variables, which we must view as a function
   of /t/ before setting it equal to

   $d/dt\left( {\partial L/\partial\overset{˙}{q}} \right)$

   .



   A correct use of the traditional notation is more explicit:

   $\frac{d}{dt}\left( \left. \frac{\partial L\left( {t,w,\overset{˙}{w}}
   \right)}{\partial{\overset{˙}{w}}^{i}} \right|_{\begin{array}{l} {w = q{(t)}}
   \\
   {\overset{˙}{w} = \frac{dq{(t)}}{dt}} \end{equation}} \right) - \left.
   \frac{\partial L\left( {t,w,\overset{˙}{w}} \right)}{\partial w^{i}}
   \right|_{\begin{array}{l} {w = q{(t)}} {\overset{˙}{w} = \frac{dq{(t)}}{dt}}
   \end{equation}} = 0,$

   where /i/ = 0, ..., /n/ − 1. In these equations we see that the partial
   derivatives of the Lagrangian function are taken, then the path and its
   derivative are substituted for the position and velocity arguments of the
   Lagrangian, resulting in an expression in terms of the time.

** A Direct Derivation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: a-direct-derivation
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Let /q/ be a realizable coordinate path from (/t/_{1}, /q/(/t/_{1})) to
   (/t/_{2}, /q/(/t/_{2})). Consider nearby paths /q/ + /ϵη/ where /η/(/t/_{1})
   = /η/(/t/_{2}) = 0. Let

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {g(\mathit{\epsilon})} & {= S\lbrack q +
   \mathit{\epsilon}\eta\rbrack(t_{1},\,\, t_{2})} & \\
   & {= {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{L(t,q(t) + \mathit{\epsilon}\eta(t),Dq(t) +
   \mathit{\epsilon}D\eta(t))dt.}}} & {(1.13)} \end{equation}

   Expanding as a power series in /ϵ/

   \begin{equation}
   {g(\mathit{\epsilon}) = g(0) + \mathit{\epsilon}Dg(0) + \cdots} & {(1.14)}
   \end{equation}

   and using the chain rule we get

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {Dg(0)} & {=
   {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{(\partial_{1}L(t,q(t),Dq(t))\eta(t))\,\, dt}}} & \\
   & {+ {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{(\partial_{2}L(t,q(t),Dq(t))D\eta(t))\,\, dt.}}} &
   {(1.15)} \end{equation}

   Integrating the second term by parts we obtain

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {Dg(0)} & {=
   {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{(\partial_{1}L(t,q(t),Dq(t))\eta(t))\,\, dt}}} & \\
   & {+ \,\partial_{2}L(t,q(t),Dq(t)D\eta(t))\eta(t)|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}} & \\
   & {-
   {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\frac{d}{dt}(\partial_{2}L(t,q(t),Dq(t)))\eta(t)dt}}.}
   & {(1.16)} \end{equation}



   The increment Δ/S/ in the action due to the variation in the path is, to
   first order in /ϵ/, /ϵDg/(0). Because $\eta$ is zero at the endpoints the
   integrated term is zero. Collecting together the other two terms, and
   reverting to functional notation, we find the increment to be

   \begin{equation}
   {\Delta S = \mathit{\epsilon}{\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\left\{ \partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack\, - \, D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) \right\}}\eta.} & {(1.17)}
   \end{equation}

   If Δ/S/ is zero the action is stationary. We retain enough freedom in the
   choice of the variation that the factor in the integrand multiplying $\eta$
   is forced to be zero at each point along the path. We argue by contradiction:
   Suppose this factor were nonzero at some particular time. Then it would have
   to be nonzero in at least one of its components. But if we choose our $\eta$
   to be a bump that is nonzero only in that component in a neighborhood of that
   time, and zero everywhere else, then the integral will be nonzero. So we may
   conclude that the factor in curly brackets is identically zero and thus
   obtain Lagrange's equations:[fn:48]

   \begin{equation}
   {D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\, - \,\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = 0.} & {(1.18)}
   \end{equation}

** The Variation Operator
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-variation-operator
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   First we will develop tools for investigating how path-dependent functions
   vary as the paths are varied. We will then apply these tools to the action,
   to derive the Lagrange equations.

   Suppose that we have a function /f/[/q/] that depends on a path /q/. How does
   the function vary as the path is varied? Let /q/ be a coordinate path and
   /q/ + /ϵη/ be a varied path, where the function $\eta$ is a path-like
   function that can be added to the path /q/, and the factor /ϵ/ is a scale
   factor. We define the /variation δ_{η}f/[/q/] of the function /f/ on the path
   /q/ by[fn:49]

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}f\lbrack q\rbrack = \underset{\mathit{\epsilon}\rightarrow 0}{\lim}\left( \frac{f\lbrack q + \mathit{\epsilon}\eta\rbrack - f\lbrack q\rbrack}{\mathit{\epsilon}} \right).} & {(1.19)}
   \end{equation}

   The variation of /f/ is a linear approximation to the change in the function
   /f/ for small variations in the path. The variation of /f/ depends on $\eta$.



   A simple example is the variation of the identity path function: /I/[/q/] =
   /q/. Applying the definition, we find

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}I\lbrack q\rbrack = \underset{\mathit{\epsilon}\rightarrow 0}{\lim}\left( \frac{(q + \mathit{\epsilon}\eta) - q}{\mathit{\epsilon}} \right) = \eta.} & {(1.20)}
   \end{equation}

   It is traditional to write /δ_{η}I/[/q/] simply as /δq/. Another example is
   the variation of the path function that returns the derivative of the path.
   We have[fn:50]

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}g\lbrack q\rbrack = \underset{\mathit{\epsilon}\rightarrow 0}{\lim}\left( \frac{D(q + \mathit{\epsilon}\eta) - Dq}{\mathit{\epsilon}} \right) = D\eta\,\,\,\,\text{with}\,\,\,\, g\lbrack q\rbrack = Dq.} & {(1.21)}
   \end{equation}

   It is traditional to write /δ_{η}g/[/q/] as /δDq/.

   The variation may be represented in terms of a derivative. Let /g/(/ϵ/) =
   /f/[/q/ + /ϵη/]; then

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}f\lbrack q\rbrack = \underset{\mathit{\epsilon}\rightarrow 0}{\lim}\left( \frac{g(\mathit{\epsilon}) - g(0)}{\mathit{\epsilon}} \right) = Dg(0).} & {(1.22)}
   \end{equation}

   Variations have the following derivative-like properties. For path-dependent
   functions /f/ and /g/ and constant /c/:

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}(f\, g)\lbrack q\rbrack = \delta_{\eta}f\lbrack q\rbrack\,\, g\lbrack q\rbrack + f\lbrack q\rbrack\,\,\delta_{\eta}g\lbrack q\rbrack} & {(1.23)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}(f + g)\lbrack q\rbrack = \delta_{\eta}f\lbrack q\rbrack\, + \,\,\delta_{\eta}g\lbrack q\rbrack} & {(1.24)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}(cf)\lbrack q\rbrack = c\,\,\delta_{\eta}f\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.25)}
   \end{equation}

   Let /F/ be a path-independent function and /g/ be a path-dependent function;
   then

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}h\lbrack q\rbrack = (DF \circ g\lbrack q\rbrack)\,\,\delta_{\eta}g\lbrack q\rbrack\,\,\,\text{with}\,\,\,\, h\lbrack q\rbrack = F \circ g\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.26)}
   \end{equation}

   The operators /D/ (differentiation) and /δ/ (variation) commute in the
   following sense:

   $$D\begin{equation} {\delta_{\eta}f\lbrack q\rbrack = \delta_{\eta}g\lbrack
   q\rbrack\,\,\,\text{with}\,\,\,\, g\lbrack q\rbrack = D(f\lbrack q\rbrack).}
   & {(1.27)} \end{equation}

   Variations also commute with integration in a similar sense.

   If a path-dependent function /f/ is stationary for a particular path /q/ with
   respect to small changes in that path, then it must be stationary for a
   subset of those variations that results from adding small multiples of a
   particular function $\eta$ to /q/. So the statement /δ_{η}f/[/q/] = 0 for
   arbitrary $\eta$ implies the function /f/ is stationary for small variations
   of the path around /q/.

   *Exercise 1.7: Properties of* /δ/

   Show that /δ/ has the properties 1.23--1.27.

   *Exercise 1.8: Implementation of* /δ/

   *a.* Suppose we have a procedure f that implements a path-dependent function:
   for path q and time t it has the value ((f q) t). The procedure delta
   computes the variation (/δ_{η}f/)[/q/](/t/) as the value of the expression
   ((((delta eta) f) q) t). Complete the definition of delta:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (((delta eta) f) q) ... )
    #+end_src

   *b.* Use your delta procedure to verify the properties of /δ/ listed in
   [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-7][exercise 1.7]] for simple functions such as implemented by the procedure
   f:[fn:51]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (f q)
  (compose (literal-function 'F (-> (UP Real (UP* Real) (UP* Real)) Real))
           (Gamma q)))
    #+end_src

   This implements an /n/-degree-of-freedom path-dependent function that depends
   on the local tuple of the path at each moment. You can define a literal
   two-dimensional path by

   (define q (literal-function 'q (-> Real (UP Real Real))))

   You should compute both sides of the equalities and subtract the results. The
   answer should be zero.

   The action is the integral of the Lagrangian along a path:

   \end{equation}



   For a realizable path /q/ the variation of the action with respect to any
   variation $\eta$ that preserves the endpoints, /η/(/t/_{1}) = /η/(/t/_{2}) =
   0, is zero:

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) = 0.} & {(1.29)}
   \end{equation}

   Variation commutes with integration, so the variation of the action is

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\delta_{\eta}h\lbrack q\rbrack\,\,\,\,\text{where}\,\,\,\, h\lbrack q\rbrack = L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.}}} & {(1.30)}

   \begin{equation}
   {\delta_{\eta}\Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack(t) = (0,\eta(t),D\eta(t)),} & {(1.31)}

   which follows from equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.20][1.20]]) and ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.21][1.21]]), and using the chain rule for
   variations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.26][1.26]]), we get[fn:52]

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {\delta_{\eta}S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2})} & {=

   q\rbrack)\eta + (\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)D\eta).}}} &
   {(1.32)} \end{equation}

   Integrating the last term of equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.32][1.32]]) by parts gives

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {\delta_{\eta}S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) =} &
   {(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\eta|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}} & \\
   & {+ {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\left\{ (\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack) - D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) \right\}\eta.}}} &
   {(1.33)} \end{equation}

   For our variation $\eta$ we have /η/(/t/_{1}) = /η/(/t/_{2}) = 0, so the
   first term vanishes.

   Thus the variation of the action is zero if and only if

   \begin{equation}
   {0 = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\left\{ (\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) \right\}\,\eta.}}} & {(1.34)}
   \end{equation}



   The variation of the action is zero because, by assumption, /q/ is a
   realizable path. Thus ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.34][1.34]]) must be true for /any/ function $\eta$ that is
   zero at the endpoints. Since $\eta$ is arbitrary, except for being zero at
   the endpoints, the bracketed factor of the integrand is zero. So

   \begin{equation}
   {D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - (\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = 0.} & {(1.35)}
   \end{equation}

   This is just what we set out to obtain, the Lagrange equations.

   A path satisfying Lagrange's equations is one for which the action is
   stationary, and the fact that the action is stationary depends only on the
   values of /L/ at each point of the path (and at each point on nearby paths),
   not on the coordinate system we use to compute these values. So if the
   system's path satisfies Lagrange's equations in some particular coordinate
   system, it must satisfy Lagrange's equations in /any/ coordinate system. Thus
   the equations of variational mechanics are derived the same way in any
   configuration space and any coordinate system.

** Harmonic oscillator
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: harmonic-oscillator
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   For an example, consider the harmonic oscillator. A Lagrangian is

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t,x,v) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}.} & {(1.36)}
   \end{equation}

   Then

   \begin{equation}
   {\partial_{1}L(t,x,v) = - kx\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\partial_{2}L(t,x,v) = mv.} & {(1.37)}
   \end{equation}

   The Lagrangian is applied to a tuple of the time, a coordinate, and a
   velocity. The symbols /t/, /x/, and /v/ are arbitrary; they are used to
   specify formal parameters of the Lagrangian.

   Now suppose we have a configuration path /y/, which gives the coordinate of
   the oscillator /y/(/t/) for each time /t/. The initial segment of the
   corresponding local tuple at time /t/ is

   \begin{equation}
   {\Gamma\lbrack y\rbrack(t) = (t,y(t),Dy(t)).} & {(1.38)}
   \end{equation}

   So

   \begin{equation}
   {(\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack y\rbrack)(t) = - ky(t)\,\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\,(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack y\rbrack)(t) = mDy(t),} & {(1.39)}
   \end{equation}

   and

   \begin{equation}
   {D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack y\rbrack)(t) = mD^{2}y(t),} & {(1.40)}
   \end{equation}

   so the Lagrange equation is



   \begin{equation} {mD^{2}y(t) + ky(t) = 0,} & {(1.41)} \end{equation}

   which is the equation of motion of the harmonic oscillator.

** Orbital motion
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: orbital-motion
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   As another example, consider the two-dimensional motion of a particle of mass
   /m/ orbiting a fixed center of attraction, with gravitational potential
   energy −/μ/r/, where /r/ is the distance to the center of attraction. This is
   called the /Kepler problem/.

   A Lagrangian for this problem is[fn:53]

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;\xi,\eta;v_{\xi},v_{\eta}) = \frac{1}{2}m(v_{\xi}^{2} + v_{\eta}^{2}) + \frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\xi^{2} + \eta^{2}}},} & {(1.42)}
   \end{equation}

   where $\xi$ and $\eta$ are formal parameters for rectangular coordinates of
   the particle, and /v_{ξ}/ and /v_{η}/ are formal parameters for corresponding
   rectangular velocity components. Then

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {\partial_{1}L(t;\xi,\eta;v_{\xi},v_{\eta})} & {=
   \lbrack\partial_{1,0}L(t;\xi,\eta;v_{\xi},v_{\eta}),\partial_{1,1}L(t;\xi,\eta;v_{\xi},v_{\eta})\rbrack}
   & \\
   & {{= \left\lbrack {\frac{- \mu\xi}{{(\xi^{2} + \eta^{2})}^{3/2}},\frac{-
   \mu\eta}{{(\xi^{2} + \eta^{2})}^{3/2}}} \right\rbrack}.} & {(1.43)}
   \end{equation}

   Similarly,

   \begin{equation}
   {\partial_{2}L(t;\xi,\eta;v_{\xi},v_{\eta}) = \lbrack mv_{\xi},mv_{\eta}\rbrack.} & {(1.44)}
   \end{equation}

   Now suppose we have a configuration path /q/ = (/x/, /y/), so that the
   coordinate tuple at time /t/ is /q/(/t/) = (/x/(/t/), /y/(/t/)). The initial
   segment of the local tuple at time /t/ is

   \begin{equation}
   {\Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack(t) = (t;x(t),y(t);Dx(t),Dy(t)).} & {(1.45)}
   \end{equation}

   So

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {(\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)(t)} & {=
   \left\lbrack {\frac{- \mu x(t)}{{({(x(t))}^{2} +
   {(y(t))}^{2})}^{3/2}},\frac{- \mu y(t)}{{({(x(t))}^{2} +
   {(y(t))}^{2})}^{3/2}}} \right\rbrack} & \\
   {(\partial_{2}\, L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)(t)} & {= \lbrack
   mDx(t),mDy(t)\rbrack} & {(1.46)} \end{equation}

   and

   \begin{equation}
   {D(\partial_{2}\, L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)(t) = \lbrack mD^{2}x(t),mD^{2}y(t)\rbrack.} & {(1.47)}
   \end{equation}



   The component Lagrange equations at time /t/ are

   \begin{equation}
   {mD^{2}x(t) + \frac{\mu x(t)}{{({(x(t))}^{2} + {(y(t))}^{2})}^{3/2}} = 0} & \\
   {mD^{2}y(t) + \frac{\mu y(t)}{{({(x(t))}^{2} + {(y(t))}^{2})}^{3/2}} = 0.} & {(1.48)}
   \end{equation}

   *Exercise 1.9: Lagrange's equations*

   Derive the Lagrange equations for the following systems, showing all of the
   intermediate steps as in the harmonic oscillator and orbital motion examples.

   *a.* An ideal planar pendulum consists of a bob of mass /m/ connected to a
   pivot by a massless rod of length /l/ subject to uniform gravitational
   acceleration /g/. A Lagrangian is

   $L(t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}) =
   \frac{1}{2}ml^{2}{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + mgl\,\,\cos\theta$

   . The formal parameters of /L/ are /t/, /θ/, and

   $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

   ; /θ/ measures the angle of the pendulum rod to a plumb line and

   $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

   is the angular velocity of the rod.[fn:54]

   *b.* A particle of mass /m/ moves in a two-dimensional potential /V/ (/x/,
   /y/) = (/x/^{2} + /y/^{2})/2 + /x/^{2}/y/ − /y/^{3}/3, where /x/ and /y/ are
   rectangular coordinates of the particle. A Lagrangian is

   $L(t;x,y;v_{x},v_{y}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}} \right) -
   V(x,y)$

   .

   *c.* A Lagrangian for a particle of mass /m/ constrained to move on a sphere
   of radius /R/ is

   $L(t;\theta,\varphi;\alpha,\beta) = \frac{1}{2}mR^{2}{({\alpha^{2} +
   {(\beta\,\sin\theta)}^{2}})}$

   . The angle /θ/ is the colatitude of the particle and /φ/ is the longitude;
   the rate of change of the colatitude is /α/ and the rate of change of the
   longitude is /β/.

   *Exercise 1.10: Higher-derivative Lagrangians*

   Derive Lagrange's equations for Lagrangians that depend on accelerations. In
   particular, show that the Lagrange equations for Lagrangians of the form
   /L/(/t, q,/ 

   q˙

   ,

   q¨

   ) with

   q¨

   terms are[fn:55]

   \begin{equation}
   {D^{2}(\partial_{3}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) + \partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = 0.} & {(1.49)}
   \end{equation}

   In general, these equations, first derived by Poisson, will involve the
   fourth derivative of /q/. Note that the derivation is completely analogous to
   the derivation of the Lagrange equations without accelerations; it is just
   longer. What restrictions must we place on the variations so that the
   critical path satisfies a differential equation?

*** 1.5.2 Computing Lagrange's Equations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-5-2

    :END:
    The procedure for computing Lagrange's equations mirrors the functional
    expression ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.12][1.12]]), where the procedure Gamma implements Γ:[fn:56]

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((Lagrange-equations Lagrangian) q)
  (- (D (compose ((partial 2) Lagrangian) (Gamma q)))
     (compose ((partial 1) Lagrangian) (Gamma q))))
     #+end_src

    The argument of Lagrange-equations is a procedure that computes a
    Lagrangian. The Lagrange-equations procedure returns a procedure that when
    applied to a path q returns a procedure of one argument (time) that computes
    the left-hand side of the Lagrange equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.12][1.12]]). These residual values
    are zero if q is a path for which the Lagrangian action is stationary.

    Observe that the Lagrange-equations procedure, like the Lagrange equations
    themselves, is valid for /any/ generalized coordinate system. When we write
    programs to investigate particular systems, the procedures that implement
    the Lagrangian function and the path /q/ will reflect the actual coordinates
    chosen to represent the system, but we use the same Lagrange-equations
    procedure in each case. This abstraction reflects the important fact that
    the method of derivation of Lagrange's equations from a Lagrangian is always
    the same; it is independent of the number of degrees of freedom, the
    topology of the configuration space, and the coordinate system used to
    describe points in the configuration space.

** The free particle
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-free-particle
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Consider again the case of a free particle. The Lagrangian is implemented by
   the procedure L-free-particle. Rather than numerically integrating and
   minimizing the action, as we did in [[file:chapter001.html#h1-5][section 1.4]], we can check Lagrange's
   equations for an arbitrary straight-line path /t/ ↦ (/at/ + /a/_{0}, /bt/ +
   /b/_{0}, /ct/ + /c/_{0}):



    #+begin_src scheme
(define (test-path t)
  (up (+ (* 'a t) 'a0) (+ (* 'b t) 'b0) (+ (* 'c t) 'c0)))

(((Lagrange-equations (L-free-particle 'm)) test-path) 't)
    #+end_src

    #+begin_src scheme
(down 0 0 0)
    #+end_src

   That the residuals are zero indicates that the test path satisfies the
   Lagrange equations.[fn:57]

   We can also apply the Lagrange-equations procedure to an arbitrary
   function:[fn:58]

   #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression
 (((Lagrange-equations (L-free-particle 'm))
   (literal-function 'x)) 't))

(* (((expt D 2) x) t) m)
   #+end_src

   $$mD^{2}x(t)$$

   The result is an expression containing the arbitrary time /t/ and mass /m/,
   so it is zero precisely when /D/^{2}/x/ = 0, which is the expected equation
   for a free particle.

** The harmonic oscillator
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-harmonic-oscillator
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Consider the harmonic oscillator again, with Lagrangian ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.10][1.10]]). We know that
   the motion of a harmonic oscillator is a sinusoid with a given amplitude,
   frequency, and phase:

   \begin{equation}
   {x(t) = a\,\,\cos(\omega t + \varphi).} & {(1.50)}
   \end{equation}



   Suppose we have forgotten how the constants in the solution relate to the
   mass /m/ and spring constant /k/ of the oscillator. Let's plug in the
   proposed solution and look at the residual:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (proposed-solution t)
  (* 'A (cos (+ (* 'omega t) 'phi))))

(show-expression (((Lagrange-equations (L-harmonic 'm 'k)) proposed-solution)
't))
    #+end_src

   $$\cos\,(\omega t + \varphi)\, A\,(k - m\omega^{2})$$

   The residual here shows that for nonzero amplitude, the only solutions
   allowed are ones where (/k/ − /mω/^{2}) = 0 or

   $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}.$

   *Exercise 1.11: Kepler's third law*

   A Lagrangian suitable for studying the relative motion of two particles, of
   masses /m/_{1} and /m/_{2}, with potential energy /V/, is:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-central-polar m V) local)
  (let ((q (coordinate local)) (qdot (velocity local)))
    (let ((r (ref q 0))

          (rdot (ref qdot 0))
          (phidot (ref qdot 1)))
      (- (* 1/2 m (+ (square rdot) (square (* r phidot))))
         (V r)))))
    #+end_src

   The argument m is the /reduced mass/ of the system

   \begin{equation}
   {m = \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{m_{1} + m_{2}}.} & {(1.51)}
   \end{equation}

   For gravity, the potential energy function is

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((gravitational-energy G m1 m2) r) (- (/ (* G m1 m2) r)))
    #+end_src

   where r is the distance between the two particles.

   Consider the simple situation of the particles in circular orbits around
   their common center of mass. Construct a circular orbit and plug it into the
   Lagrange equations. Show that the residual gives Kepler's law:

   \begin{equation}
   {n^{2}a^{3} = G(m_{1} + m_{2})} & {(1.52)}
   \end{equation}

   where /n/ is the angular frequency of the orbit and /a/ is the distance
   between the particles.



   *Exercise 1.12: Lagrange's Equations*

   Compute Lagrange's equations for the Lagrangians in [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-9][exercise 1.9]] using the
   Lagrange-equations procedure. Additionally, use the computer to perform each
   of the steps in the Lagrange-equations procedure and show the intermediate
   results. Relate these steps to the ones you showed in the hand derivation of
   [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-9][exercise 1.9]].

   *Exercise 1.13: Higher-derivative Lagrangians*

   *a.* Write a procedure to compute the Lagrange equations for Lagrangians that
   depend upon acceleration, as in [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-10][exercise 1.10]]. Note that Gamma can take an
   optional argument giving the length of the initial segment of the local tuple
   needed. The default length is 3, giving components of the local tuple up to
   and including the velocities.

   *b.* Use your procedure to compute the Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian

   $L(t,x,v,a) = - \frac{1}{2}mxa - \frac{1}{2}kx^{2}.$

   Do you recognize the resulting equation of motion?

   *c.* For more fun, write the general Lagrange equation procedure that takes a
   Lagrangian that depends on any number of derivatives, and the number of
   derivatives, to produce the required equations of motion.

* 1.6 How to Find Lagrangians
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6a
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  Lagrange's equations are a system of second-order differential equations. In
  order to use them to compute the evolution of a mechanical system, we must
  find a suitable Lagrangian for the system. There is no general way to
  construct a Lagrangian for every system, but there is an important class of
  systems for which we can identify Lagrangians in a straightforward way in
  terms of kinetic and potential energy. The key idea is to construct a
  Lagrangian /L/ such that Lagrange's equations are Newton's equations

  $\overset{\rightarrow}{F} = m\overset{\rightarrow}{a}$

  .

  Suppose our system consists of /N/ particles indexed by /α/, with mass /m_{α}/
  and vector position

  ${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}(t)$

  . Suppose further that the forces acting on the particles can be written in
  terms of a gradient of a potential energy

  $\mathcal{V}$

  that is a function of the positions of the particles and possibly time, but
  does not depend on the velocities. In other words, the force on particle /α/
  is

  ${\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}_{\alpha} = -
  {\overset{\rightarrow}{\nabla}}_{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}}\,\mathcal{V}$

  , where

  ${\overset{\rightarrow}{\nabla}}_{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}}\,\mathcal{V}$

  is the gradient of

  $\mathcal{V}$

  with respect to the position of the particle with index /α/. We can write
  Newton's equations as

  \begin{equation}
  {D(m_{\alpha}\, D{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha})(t) + {\overset{\rightarrow}{\nabla}}_{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}}\,\mathcal{V}(t,{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{0}(t),\ldots,{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{N - 1}(t)) = 0.} & {(1.53)}
  \end{equation}

  Vectors can be represented as tuples of components of the vectors on a
  rectangular basis. So

  ${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{1}(t)$

  is represented as the tuple *x*_{1}(/t/). Let /V/ be the potential energy
  function expressed in terms of components:

  \begin{equation}
  {V(t;\mathbf{x}_{0}(t),\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1}(t)) = \mathcal{V}(t,{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{0}(t),\ldots,{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{N - 1}(t)).} & {(1.54)}
  \end{equation}

  Newton's equations are

  \begin{equation}
  {D(m_{\alpha}\, D\mathbf{x}_{\alpha})(t) + \partial_{1,\alpha}V(t;\mathbf{x}_{0}(t),\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{\alpha}(t),\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1}(t)) = 0,} & {(1.55)}
  \end{equation}

  where ∂_{1,/α/}/V/ is the partial derivative of /V/ with respect to the
  *x*_{/α/}(/t/) argument slot.

  To form the Lagrange equations we collect all the position components of all
  the particles into one tuple /x/(/t/), so /x/(/t/) = (*x*_{0}(/t/), ...,
  *x*_{/N/−1}(/t/)). The Lagrange equations for the coordinate path /x/ are

  \begin{equation}
  {D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack x\rbrack) - \partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack x\rbrack = 0.} & {(1.56)}
  \end{equation}

  Observe that Newton's equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.55][1.55]]) are
  just the components of the Lagrange equations
  ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.56][1.56]]) if we choose /L/ to have the
  properties

  $$\begin{array}{lll} {(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack x\rbrack)(t)} & {=
  \lbrack m_{0}D\mathbf{x}_{0}(t),\ldots,m_{N - 1}D\mathbf{x}_{N - 1}(t)\rbrack}
  & \\
  {(\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack x\rbrack)(t)} & {= \lbrack -
  \partial_{1,0}V(t,x(t)),\ldots, - \partial_{1,N - 1}V(t,x(t))\rbrack;} &
  {(1.57)} \end{equation}

  here /V/ (/t/, /x/(/t/)) = /V/ (/t/; *x*_{0}(/t/), ..., *x*_{/N/−1}(/t/)) and
  ∂_{1,/α/}/V/ (/t/, /x/(/t/)) is the tuple of the components of the derivative
  of /V/ with respect to the coordinates of the particle with index /α/,
  evaluated at time /t/ and coordinates /x/(/t/). These conditions are satisfied
  if for every *x*_{/α/} and *v*_{/α/}



  \begin{equation} {\partial_{2}L(t;\mathbf{x}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N -
  1};\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{N - 1})} & \\ {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{=
  \lbrack m_{0}\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,m_{N - 1}\mathbf{v}_{N - 1}\rbrack}} &
  {(1.58)} \end{equation}

  and

  \begin{equation}
  {\partial_{1}L(t;\mathbf{x}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1};\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{N - 1})} & \\
  {\text{           } = \lbrack - \partial_{1,0}V(t,x),\ldots, - \partial_{1,N - 1}V(t,x)\rbrack,} & {(1.59)}
  \end{equation}

  where /x/ = (*x*_{0}, ..., *x*_{/N/−1}). One choice for /L/ that has the
  required properties
  ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.58][1.58]]--[[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.59][1.59]])
  is

  \begin{equation}
  {L(t,x,v) = \frac{1}{2}{\sum\limits_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}^{2} - V(t,x),}}} & {(1.60)}
  \end{equation}

  where

  $v_{\alpha}^{2}$

  is the sum of the squares of the components of *v*_{/α/}.[fn:59]

  The first term is the kinetic energy, conventionally denoted /T/. So this
  choice for the Lagrangian is /L/(/t/, /x/, /v/) = /T/ (/t/, /x/, /v/)−/V/
  (/t/, /x/), the difference of the kinetic and potential energy. We will often
  extend the arguments of the potential energy function to include the
  velocities so that we can write /L/ = /T/ − /V/.[fn:60]

** Hamilton's principle
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: hamiltons-principle
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Given a system of point particles for which we can identify the force as the
   (negative) derivative of a potential energy /V/ that is independent of
   velocity, we have shown that the system evolves along a path that satisfies
   Lagrange's equations with /L/ = /T/ − /V/. Having identified a Lagrangian for
   this class of systems, we can restate the principle of stationary action in
   terms of energies. This statement is known as /Hamilton's principle/: A
   point-particle system for which the force is derived from a
   velocity-independent potential energy evolves along a path /q/ for which the
   action

   $S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack}}$



   is stationary with respect to variations of the path /q/ that leave the
   endpoints fixed, where /L/ = /T/ − /V/ is the difference between kinetic and
   potential energy.[fn:61]

   It might seem that we have reduced Lagrange's equations to nothing more than

   $\overset{\rightarrow}{F} = m\overset{\rightarrow}{a}$

   , and indeed, the principle is motivated by comparing the two equations for
   this special class of systems. However, the Lagrangian formulation of the
   equations of motion has an important advantage over

   $\overset{\rightarrow}{F} = m\overset{\rightarrow}{a}$

   . Our derivation used the rectangular components *x*_{/α/} of the positions
   of the constituent particles for the generalized coordinates, but if the
   system's path satisfies Lagrange's equations in some particular coordinate
   system, it must satisfy the equations in /any/ coordinate system. Thus we see
   that /L/ = /T/ − /V/ is suitable as a Lagrangian with /any/ set of
   generalized coordinates. The equations of variational mechanics are derived
   the same way in any configuration space and any coordinate system. In
   contrast, the Newtonian formulation is based on elementary geometry: In order
   for

   $D^{2}\overset{\rightarrow}{x}(t)$

   to be meaningful as an acceleration,

   $\overset{\rightarrow}{x}(t)$

   must be a vector in physical space. Lagrange's equations have no such
   restriction on the meaning of the coordinate /q/. The generalized coordinates
   can be any parameters that conveniently describe the configurations of the

** Constant acceleration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: constant-acceleration

   :END:
   Consider a particle of mass /m/ in a uniform gravitational field with
   acceleration /g/. The potential energy is /mgh/ where /h/ is the height of
   the particle. The kinetic energy is just

   $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

   . A Lagrangian for the system is the difference of the kinetic and potential
   energies. In rectangular coordinates, with /y/ measuring the vertical
   position and /x/ measuring the horizontal position, the Lagrangian is

   $L(t;x,y;v_{x},v_{y}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}} \right) -
   mgy$

   . We have[fn:62]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-uniform-acceleration m g) local) (let ((q
   (coordinate local)) (v (velocity local))) (let ((y (ref q 1))) (- (* 1/2 m

   $$\begin{bmatrix} {mD^{2}x\,(t)} {gm + mD^{2}y\,(t)} \end{bmatrix}$$

   This equation describes unaccelerated motion in the horizontal direction
   (/mD/^{2}/x/(/t/) = 0) and constant acceleration in the vertical direction
   (/mD/^{2}/y/(/t/) = −/gm/).

** Central force field
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: central-force-field
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Consider planar motion of a particle of mass /m/ in a central force field,
   with an arbitrary potential energy /U/(/r/) depending only upon the distance
   /r/ to the center of attraction. We will derive the Lagrange equations for
   this system in both rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates.

   In rectangular coordinates (/x/, /y/), with origin at the center of
   attraction, the potential energy is

   $V(t;x,y) = U(\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}})$

   and the kinetic energy is

   $T(t;x,y;v_{x},v_{y}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}} \right)$

   . A Lagrangian for the system is /L/ = /T/ − /V/:

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;x,y;v_{x},v_{y}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}} \right) - U(\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}).} & {(1.61)}
   \end{equation}

   As a procedure:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-central-rectangular m U) local) (let ((q
   (coordinate local)) (v (velocity local))) (- (* 1/2 m (square v)) (U (sqrt
   (square q))))))
    #+end_src

   The Lagrange equations are

    #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression (((Lagrange-equations
   (L-central-rectangular 'm (literal-function 'U))) (up (literal-function 'x)
   (literal-function 'y))) 't))
    #+end_src

   $$\left\lbrack \begin{array}{l} {mD^{2}x(t) + \frac{DU\left(
   \sqrt{{(y\,\,(t))}^{2} + {(x\,\,(t))}^{2}} \right)\,
   x(t)}{\sqrt{{(y\,\,(t))}^{2} + {(x\,\,(t))}^{2}}}} {mD^{2}y(t) +
   \frac{DU\left( \sqrt{{(x\,\,(t))}^{2} + {(y\,\,(t))}^{2}} \right)\,
   y(t)}{\sqrt{{(x\,\,(t))}^{2} + {(y\,\,(t))}^{2}}}} \end{equation}
   \right\rbrack$$

   We can rewrite these Lagrange equations as:

   \begin{equation}
   {mD^{2}x(t) = - \frac{x(t)}{r(t)}DU(r(t))} & {(1.62)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {mD^{2}y(t) = - \frac{y(t)}{r(t)}DU(r(t)),} & {(1.63)}
   \end{equation}

   where

   $r(t) = \sqrt{{(x(t))}^{2} + {(y(t))}^{2}}$

   . We can interpret these as follows. The particle is subject to a radially
   directed force with magnitude −/DU/(/r/). Newton's equations equate the force
   with the product of the mass and the acceleration. The two Lagrange equations
   are just the rectangular components of Newton's equations.



   We can describe the same system in polar coordinates. The relationship
   between rectangular coordinates $(x, y)$ and polar coordinates $(r, \varphi)$
   is

   \begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
   {x = r\cos \varphi} & \\
   {y = r\sin \varphi} & {(1.64)}
   \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}

   The relationship of the generalized velocities is derived from the coordinate
   transformation. Consider a configuration path that is represented in both
   rectangular and polar coordinates. Let

   $\widetilde{x}$

   and

   $\widetilde{y}$

   be components of the rectangular coordinate path, and let

   $\widetilde{r}$

   and

   $\widetilde{\varphi}$

   be components of the corresponding polar coordinate path. The rectangular
   components at time /t/ are

   $(\widetilde{x}(t),\widetilde{y}(t))$

   and the polar coordinates at time /t/ are

   $(\widetilde{r}(t),\widetilde{\varphi}(t))$

   . They are related by ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.64][1.64]]):

   \begin{equation}
   {\widetilde{x}(t) = \widetilde{r}(t)\cos\widetilde{\varphi}(t)} & \\
   {\widetilde{y}(t) = \widetilde{r}(t)\sin\widetilde{\varphi}(t).} & {(1.65)}
   \end{equation}

   The rectangular velocity at time /t/ is

   $(D\widetilde{x}(t),\,\, D\widetilde{y}(t))$

   . Differentiating ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.65][1.65]]) gives the relationship among the velocities

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {D\widetilde{x}(t)} & {=
   D\widetilde{r}(t)\,\cos\,\widetilde{\varphi}(t) -
   \widetilde{r}(t)D\widetilde{\varphi}(t)\,\sin\,\widetilde{\varphi}(t)} & \\
   {D\widetilde{y}(t)} & {= D\widetilde{r}(t)\,\sin\,\widetilde{\varphi}(t) +
   \widetilde{r}(t)D\widetilde{\varphi}(t)\,\cos\,\widetilde{\varphi}(t).} &
   {(1.66)} \end{equation}

   These relations are valid for any configuration path at any moment, so we can
   abstract them to relations among coordinate representations of an arbitrary
   velocity. Let /v_{x}/ and /v_{y}/ be the rectangular components of the
   velocity and

   $\overset{˙}{r}$

   and

   $\overset{˙}{\varphi}$

   be the rate of change of /r/ and /φ/. Then

   \begin{equation}
   {v_{x} = \overset{˙}{r}\cos\varphi - r\overset{˙}{\varphi}\sin\varphi} & \\
   {v_{y} = \overset{˙}{r}\sin\varphi + r\overset{˙}{\varphi}\cos\varphi.} & {(1.67)}
   \end{equation}

   The kinetic energy is

   $\frac{1}{2}m(v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2})$

   :

   \begin{equation}
   {T(t;r,\varphi;\overset{˙}{r},\overset{˙}{\varphi}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {{\overset{˙}{r}}^{2} + r^{2}{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}} \right),} & {(1.68)}
   \end{equation}

   and the Lagrangian is

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;r,\varphi;\overset{˙}{r},\overset{˙}{\varphi}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {{\overset{˙}{r}}^{2} + r^{2}{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}} \right) - U(r).} & {(1.69)}
   \end{equation}



   We express this Lagrangian as follows:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-central-polar m U) local)
  (let ((q (coordinate local))
        (qdot (velocity local)))
    (let ((r (ref q 0))
          (phi (ref q 1))
          (rdot (ref qdot 0))
          (phidot (ref qdot 1)))
      (- (* 1/2 m (+ (square rdot)
                     (square (* r phidot))) )
         (U r)))))
    #+end_src

   Lagrange's equations are

    #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression
 (((Lagrange-equations
    (L-central-polar 'm (literal-function 'U)))
   (up (literal-function 'r)
       (literal-function 'phi))) 't))
    #+end_src

   $$\left\lbrack \begin{array}{l} {mD^{2}r\,(t) -
   mr\,(t)\,{(D\varphi\,\,(t))}^{2} + DU\,(r\,(t))} {2mDr\,(t)\, r\,(t)\,
   D\varphi\,(t) + mD^{2}\varphi\,(t)\,{(r\,(t))}^{2}} \end{equation}
   \right\rbrack$$

   We can interpret the first equation as saying that the product of the mass
   and the radial acceleration is the sum of the force due to the potential and
   the centrifugal force. The second equation can be interpreted as saying that
   the derivative of the angular momentum /mr/^{2}/Dφ/ is zero, so angular
   momentum is conserved.

   Note that we used the same Lagrange-equations procedure for the derivation in
   both coordinate systems. Coordinate representations of the Lagrangian are
   different for different coordinate systems, and the Lagrange equations in
   different coordinate systems look different. Yet the same method is used to
   derive the Lagrange equations in any coordinate system.

   *Exercise 1.14: Coordinate-independence of Lagrange equations*

   Check that the Lagrange equations for central force motion in polar
   coordinates and in rectangular coordinates are equivalent. Determine the
   relationship among the second derivatives by substituting paths into the
   transformation equations and computing derivatives, then substitute these
   relations into the equations of motion.



*** 1.6.1 Coordinate Transformations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-6-1
    :CLASS:    level3
    :END:
    The motion of a system is independent of the coordinates we use to describe
    it. This coordinate-free nature of the motion is apparent in the action
    principle. The action depends only on the value of the Lagrangian along the
    path and not on the particular coordinates used in the representation of the
    Lagrangian. We can use this property to find a Lagrangian in one coordinate
    system in terms of a Lagrangian in another coordinate system.

    Suppose we have a mechanical system whose motion is described by a
    Lagrangian /L/ that depends on time, coordinates, and velocities. And
    suppose we have a coordinate transformation /F/ such that /x/ = /F/ (/t/,
    /x/′). The Lagrangian /L/ is expressed in terms of the unprimed coordinates.
    We want to find a Lagrangian /L/′ expressed in the primed coordinates that
    describes the same system. One way to do this is to require that the value
    of the Lagrangian along any configuration path be independent of the
    coordinate system. If /q/ is a path in the unprimed coordinates and /q/′ is
    the corresponding path in primed coordinates, then the Lagrangians must
    satisfy:

    \begin{equation}
    {L\prime \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\prime\rbrack = L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.70)}
    \end{equation}

    We have seen that the transformation from rectangular to polar coordinates
    implies that the generalized velocities transform in a certain way. The
    velocity transformation can be deduced from the requirement that a path in
    polar coordinates and a corresponding path in rectangular coordinates are
    consistent with the coordinate transformation. In general, the requirement
    that paths in two different coordinate systems be consistent with the
    coordinate transformation can be used to deduce how all of the components of
    the local tuple transform. Given a coordinate transformation /F/, let /C/ be
    the corresponding function that maps local tuples in the primed coordinate
    system to corresponding local tuples in the unprimed coordinate system:

    \begin{equation}
    {C \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\prime\rbrack = \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.71)}
    \end{equation}

    We will deduce the general form of /C/ below.



    Given such a local-tuple transformation /C/, a Lagrangian /L/′ that
    satisfies equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.70][1.70]]) is

    \begin{equation}
    {L\prime = L \circ C} & {(1.72)}
    \end{equation}

    We can see this by substituting for /L/′ in equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.70][1.70]]):

    \begin{equation}
    {L\prime \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\prime\rbrack = L \circ C \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\prime\rbrack = L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.73)}
    \end{equation}

    To find the local-tuple transformation /C/ given a coordinate transformation
    /F/, we deduce how each component of the local tuple transforms. The
    coordinate transformation specifies how the coordinate component of the
    local tuple transforms

    \begin{equation}
    {x = F(t,x\prime).} & {(1.74)}
    \end{equation}

    The generalized-velocity component of the local-tuple transformation can be
    deduced as follows. Let /q/ and /q/′ be the same configuration path
    expressed in the two coordinate systems. Substituting these paths into the
    coordinate transformation and computing the derivative, we find

    \begin{equation}
    {Dq(t) = \partial_{0}F(t,q\prime(t)) + \partial_{1}F(t,q\prime(t))Dq\prime(t).} & {(1.75)}
    \end{equation}

    Through any point there is always a path of any given velocity, so we may
    generalize and conclude that along corresponding coordinate paths the
    generalized velocities satisfy

    \begin{equation}
    {v = \partial_{0}F(t,x\prime) + \partial_{1}F(t,x\prime)v\prime.} & {(1.76)}
    \end{equation}

    If needed, rules for higher-derivative components of the local tuple can be
    determined in a similar fashion. The local-tuple transformation that takes a
    local tuple in the primed system to a local tuple in the unprimed system is
    constructed from the component transformations:

    $$\begin{array}{lll} {(t,x,v,\ldots)} & {= C(t,x\prime,v\prime,\ldots)} & \\
    & {= (t,F(t,x\prime),\,\,\partial_{0}F(t,x\prime) +
    \partial_{1}F(t,x\prime)v\prime,\ldots).} & {(1.77)} \end{equation}

    So if we take the Lagrangian /L/′ to be

    \begin{equation}
    {L\prime = L \circ C,} & {(1.78)}
    \end{equation}



    then the action has a value that is independent of the coordinate system
    used to compute it. The configuration path of stationary action does not
    depend on which coordinate system is used to describe the path. The Lagrange
    equations derived from these Lagrangians will in general look very different
    from one another, but they must be equivalent.

    *Exercise 1.15: Equivalence*

    Show by direct calculation that the Lagrange equations for /L/′ are
    satisfied if the Lagrange equations for /L/ are satisfied.

    Given a coordinate transformation /F/, we can use
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.77][1.77]]) to find the function /C/ that
    transforms local tuples. The procedure F->C implements this:[fn:63]

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((F->C F) local) (up (time local) (F local)
    (+ (((partial 0) F) local) (* (((partial 1) F) local) (velocity local)))))

     #+end_src

    As an illustration, consider the transformation from polar to rectangular
    coordinates, /x/ = /r/ cos /φ/ and /y/ = /r/ sin /φ/, with the following
    implementation:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define (p->r local) (let ((polar-tuple (coordinate local))) (let ((r (ref
polar-tuple 0)) (phi (ref polar-tuple 1))) (let ((x
    (* r (cos phi))) (y (* r (sin phi)))) (up x y)))))
     #+end_src

    In terms of the polar coordinates and the rates of change of the polar
    coordinates, the rates of change of the rectangular components are[fn:64]



     #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression (velocity ((F->C p->r) (up 't (up 'r 'phi) (up 'rdot
'phidot)))))
     #+end_src

    $$\begin{pmatrix} {- \overset{˙}{\varphi}r\sin\,(\varphi) +
    \overset{˙}{r}\cos\,(\varphi)} {\overset{˙}{\varphi}r\cos\,(\varphi) +
    \overset{˙}{r}\sin\,(\varphi)} \end{pmatrix}$$

    We can use F->C to find the Lagrangian for central force motion in polar
    coordinates from the Lagrangian in rectangular components, using equation
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.72][1.72]]):

        #+begin_src scheme
(define (L-central-polar m U) (compose
    (L-central-rectangular m U) (F->C p->r))) (show-expression ((L-central-polar
    'm (literal-function 'U)) (up 't (up 'r 'phi) (up 'rdot 'phidot)))) {%

        #+end_src

    $$\frac{1}{2}m{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}r^{2} +
    \frac{1}{2}m{\overset{˙}{r}}^{2} - U(r)$$

    The result is the same as Lagrangian
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.69][1.69]]).

    *Exercise 1.16: Central force motion*

    Find Lagrangians for central force motion in three dimensions in rectangular
    coordinates and in spherical coordinates. First, find the Lagrangians
    analytically, then check the results with the computer by generalizing the
    programs that we have presented.

** Coriolis and centrifugal forces
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: coriolis-and-centrifugal-forces
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   The equations of motion of a free particle in a rotating coordinate system
   have additional terms. Consider a free particle moving in two dimensions. A
   Lagrangian is:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-free-rectangular m) local) (let ((vx (ref
   (velocities local) 0)) (vy (ref (velocities local) 1))) (* 1/2 m (+ (square
vx) (square vy)))))
    #+end_src

   The rotation will be easy to describe in polar coordinates, so we transform
   to polar coordinates:



    #+begin_src scheme
(define (L-free-polar m) (compose (L-free-rectangular m) (F->C p->r)))
    #+end_src

   Now we can make a simple time-dependent transformation to rotating
   coordinates, with rate of rotation Omega:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((F Omega) local) (let ((t (time local)) (r
   (ref (coordinates local) 0)) (theta (ref (coordinates local) 1))) (up r (+
   theta (* Omega t))))) (define (L-rotating-polar m Omega) (compose
   (L-free-polar m) (F->C (F Omega))))
    #+end_src

   Now let's transform back to rectangular coordinates:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (L-rotating-rectangular m Omega) (compose
   (L-rotating-polar m Omega) (F->C r->p)))
    #+end_src

   The new Lagrangian, in the rotating rectangular coordinate system is:

    #+begin_src scheme
((L-rotating-rectangular 'm 'Omega) (up 't (up 'x_r 'y_r) (up 'xdot_r
'ydot_r))) (+ (* 1/2 (expt Omega 2) m (expt x_r 2)) (* 1/2
   (expt Omega 2) m (expt y_r 2)) (* -1 Omega m xdot_r y_r) (* Omega m ydot_r
x_r) (* 1/2 m (expt xdot_r 2)) (* 1/2 m (expt ydot_r 2)))
    #+end_src

   Although the transformation of coordinates is time dependent the resulting
   Lagrangian is independent of time.

   The Lagrange equations for the free particle in the rotating coordinate
   system have force terms involving the angular velocity Ω:

    #+begin_src scheme
(((Lagrange-equations (L-rotating-rectangular 'm 'Omega)) (up (literal-function
'x r) (literal-function 'y r))) 't) (down (+
   (* -1 (expt Omega 2) m (x_r t)) (* -2 Omega m ((D y_r) t)) (* m (((expt D 2)
   x_r) t))) (+ (* -1 (expt Omega 2) m (y_r t)) (* 2 Omega m ((D x_r) t)) (* m
   (((expt D 2) y_r) t))))
    #+end_src



   The terms that are proportional to Ω^{2} are called /centrifugal force/
   terms, and the ones that are proportional to Ω are called /Coriolis/ force
   terms. Note that the centrifugal force terms are radial, pointing away from
   the center of rotation. These additional force terms are derived from the
   corresponding terms in the Lagrangian. The terms in the Lagrangian that are
   proportional to Ω^{2} can be thought of as the negation of a /centrifugal
   potential energy/.

   Because this is a free particle the velocity in the original unrotated
   coordinates is constant. In rotating coordinates, the Coriolis terms describe
   an acceleration that is perpendicular to the velocity, causing the trajectory
   to curve.

    We have found that /L/ = /T/ − /V/ is a suitable Lagrangian for a system of
    point particles subject to forces derived from a potential. Extended bodies
    can sometimes be conveniently idealized as a system of point particles
    connected by rigid constraints. We will find that /L/ = /T/ − /V/, expressed
    in irredundant coordinates, is also a suitable Lagrangian for modeling
    systems of point particles with rigid constraints. We will first illustrate
    the method and then provide a justification.

   The system is presumed to be made of /N/ point masses, indexed by /α/, in
   ordinary three-dimensional space. The first step is to choose a convenient
   set of irredundant generalized coordinates /q/ and redescribe the system in
   terms of these. In terms of the generalized coordinates the rectangular
   coordinates of particle /α/ are

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathbf{x}_{\alpha} = f_{\alpha}(t,q).} & {(1.79)}
   \end{equation}

   For irredundant coordinates /q/ all the coordinate constraints are built into
   the functions /f_{α}/. We deduce the relationship of the generalized
   velocities /v/ to the velocities of the constituent particles *v*_{/α/} by
   inserting path functions into equation
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.79][1.79]]), differentiating, and abstracting
   to arbitrary velocities (see [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-1][section
   1.6.1]]). We find

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathbf{v}_{\alpha} = \partial_{0}f_{\alpha}(t,q) + \partial_{1}f_{\alpha}(t,q)v.} & {(1.80)}
   \end{equation}

   We use equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.79][1.79]]) and
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.80][1.80]]) to express the kinetic energy in
   terms of the generalized coordinates and velocities. Let

   $\widetilde{T}$

   be the kinetic energy as a function of the rectangular coordinates and
   velocities:

   \begin{equation}
   {\widetilde{T}(t;\mathbf{x}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1};\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{N - 1}) = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\mathbf{v}_{\alpha}^{2},}}} & {(1.81)}
   \end{equation}

   where

   $\mathbf{v}_{\alpha}^{2}$

   is the squared magnitude of *v*_{/α/}. As a function of the generalized
   coordinate tuple /q/ and the generalized velocity tuple /v/, the kinetic
   energy is

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {T(t,q,v)} & {=
   \widetilde{T}(t,f(t,q),\partial_{0}f(t,q) + \partial_{1}f(t,q)v)} & \\
   & {=
   {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{(\partial_{0}f_{\alpha}(t,q) +
   \partial_{1}f_{\alpha}(t,q)v)}^{2}.}}} & {(1.82)} \end{equation}

   Similarly, we use equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.79][1.79]]) to
   reexpress the potential energy in terms of the generalized coordinates. Let

   $\widetilde{V}(t,x)$

   be the potential energy at time /t/ in the configuration specified by the
   tuple of rectangular coordinates /x/. Expressed in generalized coordinates
   the potential energy is

   \begin{equation}
   {V(t,q,v) = \widetilde{V}(t,f(t,q)).} & {(1.83)}
   \end{equation}

   We take the Lagrangian to be the difference of the kinetic energy and the
   potential energy: /L/ = /T/ − /V/.

   the hinge is completely free: the members can go through all configurations
   without collision. Formulate a Lagrangian that describes the system and find
   the Lagrange equations of motion. Use the computer to do this, because the

** Why it works
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: why-it-works
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   In this section we show that /L/ = /T/ − /V/ is in fact a suitable Lagrangian
   for rigidly constrained systems. We do this by requiring that the Lagrange
   equations be equivalent to the Newtonian vectorial dynamics with vector
   constraint forces.[fn:65]

   We consider a system of particles. The particle with index /α/ has mass
   /m_{α}/ and position

   ${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}(t)$

   at time /t/. There may be a very large number of these particles, or just a
   few. Some of the positions may also be specified functions of time, such as
   the position of the pivot of a driven pendulum. There are rigid position
   constraints among some of the particles. We assume that all of these
   constraints are of the form

   \begin{equation}
   {({\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}(t) - {\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\beta}(t)) \cdot ({\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}(t) - {\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\beta}(t)) = l_{\alpha\beta}^{2};} & {(1.90)}
   \end{equation}

   that is, the distance between particles /α/ and /β/ is /l_{αβ}/.

   The Newtonian equation of motion for particle /α/ says that the mass times
   the acceleration of particle /α/ is equal to the sum of the potential forces
   and the constraint forces. The potential forces are derived as the negative
   gradient of the potential energy, and may depend on the positions of the
   other particles and the time. The constraint forces

   ${\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}_{\alpha\beta}$

   are the vector constraint forces associated with the rigid constraint between
   particle /α/ and particle /β/. So

   \begin{equation}
   {D(m_{\alpha}D{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha})(t)} & \\
   {\text{       } = - {\overset{\rightarrow}{\nabla}}_{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}\alpha}\mathcal{V}(t,{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{0}(t),\ldots,{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{N - 1}(t)) + {\sum\limits_{\{\beta|\beta\leftrightarrow\alpha\}}{{\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}_{\alpha\beta}(t),}}} & {(1.91)}
   \end{equation}

   where in the summation /β/ ranges over only those particle indices for which
   there are rigid constraints with the particle indexed by /α/; we use the
   notation /β/ ↔ /α/ for the relation that there is a rigid constraint between
   the indicated particles.



   The force of constraint is directed along the line between the particles, so
   we may write

   \begin{equation}
   {{\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}_{\alpha\beta}(t) = F_{\alpha\beta}(t)\frac{{\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\beta}(t) - {\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha}(t)}{l_{\alpha\beta}}} & {(1.92)}
   \end{equation}

   where /F_{αβ}/(/t/) is the scalar magnitude of the tension in the constraint
   at time /t/. Note that

   ${\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}_{\alpha\beta} = -
   {\overset{\rightarrow}{F}}_{\beta\alpha}$

   . In general, the scalar constraint forces change as the system evolves.

   Formally, we can reproduce Newton's equations with the Lagrangian[fn:66]

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {L(t;x,F;\overset{˙}{x},\overset{˙}{F}) =} &
   {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\mathbf{\overset{˙}{x}}_{\alpha}^{2} -
   V(t,x)}} & \\
   & {- {\sum\limits_{\{\alpha,\beta|\alpha <
   \beta,\alpha\leftrightarrow\beta\}}{\frac{F_{\alpha\beta}}{2l_{\alpha\beta}}\lbrack{(\mathbf{x}_{\beta} -
   \mathbf{x}_{\alpha})}^{2} - l_{\alpha\beta}^{2}\rbrack}}} & {(1.93)}
   \end{equation}

   where the constraint forces are being treated as additional generalized
   coordinates. Here /x/ is a structure composed of all the rectangular
   components *x*_{/α/} of all the

   ${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\alpha},\overset{˙}{x}$

   is a structure composed of all the rectangular components

   $\mathbf{\overset{˙}{x}}_{\alpha}$

   of all the velocity vectors

   ${\overset{\rightarrow}{v}}_{\alpha}$

   , and /F/ is a structure composed of all the /F_{αβ}/. The velocity of /F/
   does not appear in the Lagrangian, and /F/ itself appears only linearly. So
   the Lagrange equations associated with /F/ are

   \begin{equation}
   {{(\mathbf{x}_{\beta}(t) - \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}(t))}^{2} - l_{\alpha\beta}^{2} = 0} & {(1.94)}
   \end{equation}

   but this is just a restatement of the constraints. The Lagrange equations for
   the coordinates of the particles are Newton's equations
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.91][1.91]])

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {D(mD\mathbf{x}_{\alpha})(t)} & {= -
   \partial_{1,\alpha}V(t,x(t))} & \\
   & {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, +
   {\sum\limits_{\{\beta|\alpha\leftrightarrow\beta\}}{F_{\alpha\beta}(t)\frac{\mathbf{x}_{\beta}(t) -
   \mathbf{x}_{\alpha}(t)}{l_{\alpha\beta}}}}.} & {(1.95)} \end{equation}



   Now that we have a suitable Lagrangian, we can use the fact that Lagrangians
   can be reexpressed in any generalized coordinates to find a simpler
   Lagrangian. The strategy is to choose a new set of coordinates for which many
   of the coordinates are constants and the remaining coordinates are
   irredundant.

   Let /q/ be a tuple of generalized coordinates that specify the degrees of
   freedom of the system without redundancy. Let /c/ be a tuple of other
   generalized coordinates that specify the distances between particles for
   which constraints are specified. The /c/ coordinates will have constant
   values. The combination of /q/ and /c/ replaces the redundant rectangular
   coordinates /x/.[fn:67] In addition, we still have the /F/ coordinates, which
   are the scalar constraint forces. Our new coordinates are the components of
   /q/, /c/, and /F/.

   There exist functions /f_{α}/ that give the rectangular coordinates of the
   constituent particles in terms of /q/ and /c/:

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathbf{x}_{\alpha} = f_{\alpha}(t,q,c).} & {(1.96)}
   \end{equation}

   To reexpress the Lagrangian in terms of /q/, /c/, and /F/, we need to find
   *v*_{/α/} in terms of the generalized velocities

   q˙

   and

   c˙

   : we do this by differentiating /f_{α}/ along a path and abstracting to
   arbitrary velocities (see [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-1][section 1.6.1]]):

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathbf{v}_{\alpha} = \partial_{0}f_{\alpha}(t,q,c) + \partial_{1}f_{\alpha}(t,q,c)\,\,\overset{˙}{q} + \partial_{2}f_{\alpha}(t,q,c)\,\,\overset{˙}{c}.} & {(1.97)}
   \end{equation}

   Substituting these into Lagrangian
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.93][1.93]]), and using

   \begin{equation}
   {c_{\alpha\beta}^{2} = {(\mathbf{x}_{\beta} - \mathbf{x}_{\alpha})}^{2},} & {(1.98)}
   \end{equation}

   we find

   \begin{equation}
   {L\prime(t;q,c,F;\overset{˙}{q},\overset{˙}{c},\overset{˙}{F})} & \\
   {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{(\partial_{0}f_{\alpha}(t,q,c) + \partial_{1}f_{\alpha}(t,q,c)\,\,\overset{˙}{q} + \partial_{2}f_{\alpha}(t,q,c)\,\,\overset{˙}{c})}^{2}}}} & \\
   {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, - V(t,f(t,q,c)) - {\sum\limits_{\{\alpha,\beta|\alpha < \beta,\alpha\leftrightarrow\beta\}}{\frac{F_{\alpha\beta}}{2l_{\alpha\beta}}\lbrack c_{\alpha\beta}^{2} - l_{\alpha\beta}^{2}\rbrack.}}} & {(1.99)}
   \end{equation}



   The Lagrange equations are derived by the usual procedure. Rather than write
   out all the gory details, let's think about how it will go.

   The Lagrange equations associated with /F/ just restate the constraints:

   \begin{equation}
   {0 = c_{\alpha\beta}^{2}(t) - l_{\alpha\beta}^{2}} & {(1.100)}
   \end{equation}

   and consequently we know that along a solution path, /c/(/t/) = /l/ and
   /Dc/(/t/) = /D/^{2}/c/(/t/) = 0. We can use this result to simplify the
   Lagrange equations associated with /q/ and /c/.

   The Lagrange equations associated with /q/ are the same as if they were
   derived from the Lagrangian[fn:68]

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {L''(t,q,\overset{˙}{q})} & {=
   {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{(\partial_{0}f_{\alpha}(t,q,l) +
   \partial_{1}f_{\alpha}(t,q,l)\,\,\overset{˙}{q})}^{2}}}} & \\
   & {\,\,\, - V(t,f(t,q,l)),} & {(1.101)} \end{equation}

   but this is exactly /T/ − /V/ where /T/ and /V/ are computed from the
   generalized coordinates /q/, with fixed constraints. Notice that the
   constraint forces do not appear in the Lagrange equations for /q/ because in
   the Lagrange equations they are multiplied by a term that is identically zero
   on the solution paths. So the Lagrange equations for /T/ − /V/ with
   irredundant generalized coordinates /q/ and fixed constraints are equivalent
   to Newton's equations with vector constraint forces.

   The Lagrange equations for /c/ can be used to find the constraint forces. The
   Lagrange equations are a big mess so we will not show them explicitly, but in
   general they are equations in /D/^{2}/c/, /Dc/, and /c/ that will depend upon
   /q/, /Dq/, and /F/. The dependence on /F/ is linear, so we can solve for /F/
   in terms of the solution path /q/ and /Dq/, with /c/ = /l/ and /Dc/ =
   /D/^{2}/c/ = 0.

   If we are not interested in the constraint forces, we can abandon the full
   Lagrangian ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.99][1.99]]) in favor of Lagrangian
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.101][1.101]]), which is equivalent as far as
   the evolution of the generalized coordinates /q/ is concerned.

   #+caption: *Figure 1.5* A rigid rod of length /l/ constrains two massive
   particles in a plane. [[file:images/Art_P166.jpg]]

   The same derivation goes through even if the lengths /l_{αβ}/ specified in
   the interparticle distance constraints are a function of time. It can also be
   generalized to allow distance constraints to time-dependent positions, by
   making some of the positions of particles

   ${\overset{\rightarrow}{x}}_{\beta}$

   be specified functions of time.

   *Exercise 1.21: A dumbbell*

   In this exercise we will recapitulate the derivation of the Lagrangian for
   constrained systems for a particular simple system.

   Consider two massive particles in the plane constrained by a massless rigid
   rod to remain a distance /l/ apart, as in
   [[file:chapter001.html#Fig_1-5][figure 1.5]]. There are apparently four
   degrees of freedom for two massive particles in the plane, but the rigid rod
   reduces this number to three.

   We can uniquely specify the configuration with the redundant coordinates of
   the particles, say /x/_{0}(/t/), /y/_{0}(/t/) and /x/_{1}(/t/), /y/_{1}(/t/).
   The constraint (/x/_{1}(/t/) − /x/_{0}(/t/))^{2} + (/y/_{1}(/t/) −
   /y/_{0}(/t/))^{2} = /l/^{2} eliminates one degree of freedom.

   *a.* Write Newton's equations for the balance of forces for the four
   rectangular coordinates of the two particles, given that the scalar tension
   in the rod is /F/.

   *b.* Write the formal Lagrangian

   $L(t;x_{0},y_{0},x_{1},y_{1},F;{\overset{˙}{x}}_{0},{\overset{˙}{y}}_{0},{\overset{˙}{x}}_{1},{\overset{˙}{y}}_{1},\overset{˙}{F})$

   such that Lagrange's equations will yield the Newton's equations you derived
   in part *a*.

   *c.* Make a change of coordinates to a coordinate system with center of mass
   coordinates /x/_{CM}, /y/_{CM}, angle /θ/, distance between the particles
   /c/, and tension force /F/. Write the Lagrangian in these coordinates, and
   write the Lagrange equations.



   *d.* You may deduce from one of these equations that /c/(/t/) = /l/. From
   this fact we get that /Dc/ = 0 and /D/^{2}/c/ = 0. Substitute these into the
   Lagrange equations you just computed to get the equation of motion for
   /x/_{CM}, /y/_{CM}, /θ/.

   *e.* Make a Lagrangian (= /T/ − /V/) for the system described with the
   irredundant generalized coordinates /x/_{CM}, /y/_{CM}, /θ/ and compute the
   Lagrange equations from this Lagrangian. They should be the same equations as
   you derived for the same coordinates in part *d*.

   *Exercise 1.22: Driven pendulum*

   Show that the Lagrangian ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.93][1.93]]) can be
   used to describe the driven pendulum
   ([[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]), where the position of the
   pivot is a specified function of time: Derive the equations of motion using
   the Newtonian constraint force prescription, and show that they are the same
   as the Lagrange equations. Be sure to examine the equations for the
   constraint forces as well as the position of the pendulum bob.

   *Exercise 1.23: Fill in the details*

   Show that the Lagrange equations for Lagrangian
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.101][1.101]]) are the same as the Lagrange
   equations for Lagrangian ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.99][1.99]]) with the
   substitution /c/(/t/) = /l/, /Dc/(/t/) = /D/^{2}/c/(/t/) = 0.

*** 1.6.3 Constraints as Coordinate Transformations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-6-3
    :CLASS:    level3
    :END:
    The derivation of a Lagrangian for a constrained system involves steps that
    are analogous to those in the derivation of a coordinate transformation.

    We can make a Lagrangian for the unconstrained system of particles in
    rectangular coordinates. In general there will be more coordinates than real
    degrees of freedom; the constraints will eliminate the redundancy. We then
    choose a convenient set of irredundant generalized coordinates that
    incorporate the constraints to describe our system. We express the redundant
    rectangular coordinates and velocities in terms of the irredundant
    generalized coordinates and generalized velocities, and we use these
    transformations to reexpress the Lagrangian in the generalized coordinates.

    To carry out a coordinate transformation we specify how the configuration of
    a system expressed in one set of generalized coordinates can be reexpressed
    in terms of another set of generalized coordinates. We then determine the
    transformation of generalized velocities implied by the transformation of
    generalized coordinates. A Lagrangian that is expressed in terms of one of
    the sets of generalized coordinates can then be reexpressed in terms of the
    other set of generalized coordinates.

    These are really two applications of the same process, so we can make
    Lagrangians for constrained systems by composing a Lagrangian for
    unconstrained particles with a coordinate transformation that incorporates
    the constraint. Our deduction that /L/ = /T/ − /V/ is a suitable Lagrangian
    for a constrained systems was in fact based on a coordinate transformation
    from a set of coordinates subject to constraints to a set of irredundant
    coordinates plus constraint coordinates that are constant.

    Let *x*_{/α/} be the tuple of rectangular components of the constituent
    particle with index /α/, and let *v*_{/α/} be its velocity. The Lagrangian

    \begin{equation}
    {L_{f}(t;\mathbf{x}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1};\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{N - 1})} & \\
    {\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}\mathbf{v}_{\alpha}^{2} - V(t;\mathbf{x}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1};\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{N - 1})}}} & {(1.102)}
    \end{equation}

    is the difference of kinetic and potential energies of the constituent
    particles. This is a suitable Lagrangian for a set of unconstrained free
    particles with potential energy /V/.

    Let /q/ be a tuple of irredundant generalized coordinates and /v/ be the
    corresponding generalized velocity tuple. The coordinates /q/ are related to
    *x*_{/α/}, the coordinates of the constituent particles, by *x*_{/α/} =
    /f_{α}/(/t/, /q/), as before. The constraints among the constituent
    particles are taken into account in the definition of the /f_{α}/. Here we
    view this as a coordinate transformation. What is unusual about this as a
    coordinate transformation is that the dimension of /x/ is not the same as
    the dimension of /q/. From this coordinate transformation we can find the
    local-tuple transformation function (see
    [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-1][section 1.6.1]])

    \begin{equation}
    {(t;\mathbf{x}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N - 1};\mathbf{v}_{0},\ldots,\mathbf{v}_{N - 1}) = C(t,q,v).} & {(1.103)}
    \end{equation}

    A Lagrangian for the constrained system can be obtained from the Lagrangian
    for the unconstrained system by composing it with the local-tuple
    transformation function from constrained coordinates to unconstrained
    coordinates:

    \begin{equation}
    {L = L_{f} \circ C.} & {(1.104)}
    \end{equation}

    The constraints enter only in the transformation.

    To illustrate this we will find a Lagrangian for the driven pendulum
    introduced in [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]. As we saw on
    [[file:chapter001.html#p40][page 40]], the /T/ − /V/ Lagrangian for a free
    particle of mass /m/ in a vertical plane subject to a gravitational
    potential with acceleration /g/ is

    \begin{equation}
    {L_{f}\left( {t;x,y;v_{x},v_{y}} \right) = \frac{1}{2}m(v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2}) - mgy,} & {(1.105)}
    \end{equation}

    where /y/ measures the height of the point mass. A program that computes
    this Lagrangian is

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-uniform-acceleration m g) local) (let ((q
    (coordinate local)) (v (velocity local))) (let ((y (ref q 1))) (- (* 1/2 m
    (square v)) (* m g y)))))
     #+end_src

    The coordinate transformation from generalized coordinate /θ/ to rectangular
    coordinates is /x/ = /l/ sin /θ/, /y/ = /y_{s}/(/t/) − /l/ cos /θ/, where
    /l/ is the length of the pendulum and /y_{s}/ gives the height of the
    support as a function of time. It is interesting that the drive enters only
    through the specification of the constraints. A program implementing this
    coordinate transformation is

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((dp-coordinates l y_s) local) (let ((t (time local)) (theta (coordinate
local))) (let ((x (* l (sin theta))) (y (- (y_s t) (* l (cos theta))))) (up x
y))))
     #+end_src

    Using F->C we can deduce the local-tuple transformation and define the
    Lagrangian for the driven pendulum by composition:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define (L-pend m l g y_s) (compose
    (L-uniform-acceleration m g) (F->C (dp-coordinates l y_s))))
     ,#+end_src  %}



    The Lagrangian is

     ,#+begin_src scheme
(show-expression ((L-pend 'm 'l 'g (literal-function 'y_s)) (up 't 'theta
'thetadot)))
     #+end_src

    $$glm\,\cos\,(\theta) - gmy_{s}\,(t) +
    \frac{1}{2}l^{2}m{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} +
    lm\overset{˙}{\theta}Dy_{s}\,(t)\sin\left( \theta \right) +
    \frac{1}{2}m{(Dy_{s}(t))}^{2}$$

    This is the same as the Lagrangian of equation
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.88][1.88]]) on
    [[file:chapter001.html#p51][page 51]].

    We have found a very interesting decomposition of the Lagrangian for
    constrained systems. One part consists of the difference of the kinetic and
    potential energy of the constituents. The other part describes the
    constraints that are specific to the configuration of a particular system.

    *Exercise 1.25: Foucault pendulum Lagrangian*

    A Foucault pendulum is a long-period pendulum of length /l/ and mass /m/
    that is suspended at a height /l/ above the surface of the Earth (radius
    /R/) at colatitude /ϕ/. If the pendulum is released, at rest, with nonzero
    displacement from the local vertical, it will oscillate in an apparent
    plane. However, the apparent plane of oscillation precesses as the Earth
    rotates. The Earth rotates with angular speed Ω.

    One way to specify the position of the bob is to erect a Foucault pendulum
    at the North Pole and rotate it to a point on the surface of the Earth at
    the appropriate colatitude and a fixed longitude. Because the Earth is
    rotating this is a time-varying transformation. There are two parts of this
    transformation.

    First, we relate the generalized coordinates /θ/ and /λ/ to the coordinates
    of the pendulum bob with the pendulum at the North pole. Let /θ/ be the
    angle of the bob relative to the line through the center of the Earth and
    let /λ/ be the precession angle. The rectangular coordinates of the bob for
    a pendulum at the North Pole are:

    /x/_{0} = /l/ sin /θ/ cos /λ/

    /y/_{0} = /l/ sin /θ/ sin /λ/

    /z/_{0} = (/R/ + /l/) − /l/ cos /θ/.

    Next, we rotate the pendulum to its actual location at colatitude /ϕ/. We
    can choose the longitude to be zero, so the angular position of the support
    of the bob is rotated by Ω/t/. The transformation of coordinates is:[fn:69]

    $(x,y,z) = R_{z}(\Omega t)R_{y}(\phi)(x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}).$



    This second transformation can be implemented with the following code:

     #+begin_src scheme
((compose (Rz (* 'Omega 't)) (Ry 'phi)) (up 'x_0 'y_0 'z_0)) (up (+ (* x_0 (cos
phi) (cos (* Omega t))) (* z_0 (sin phi) (cos (* Omega t))) (* -1 y_0 (sin (*
Omega t)))) (+ (* x_0 (cos phi) (sin (* Omega t))) (* z_0 (sin phi) (sin (*
Omega t))) (* y_0 (cos (* Omega t)))) (+ (* -1 x_0 (sin phi)) (* z_0 (cos
phi))))
     #+end_src

    Construct a coordinate transformation F from these parts that you can use
    with F->C to compose with the free Lagrangian for a particle in a
    gravitational potential to make a Lagrangian for the Foucault pendulum. The
    Newtonian potential energy is −/GMm/r/, where /r/ is the distance of the bob
    from the center of the Earth, and /M/ is the mass of the Earth.

    Lagrangians are not in a one-to-one relationship with physical
    systems---many Lagrangians can be used to describe the same physical system.
    In this section we will demonstrate this by showing that the addition to the
    Lagrangian of a “total time derivative” of a function of the coordinates and
    time does not change the paths of stationary action or the equations of
    motion deduced from the action principle.

** Total time derivatives
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: total-time-derivatives
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Let's first explain what we mean by a “total time derivative.” Let /F/ be a
   function of time and coordinates. The function /F/ on the path at time /t/ is

   \begin{equation}
   {(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)(t) = F(t,q(t)).} & {(1.106)}
   \end{equation}

   So, by the chain rule

   \begin{equation}
   {D(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)(t) = \partial_{0}F(t,q(t)) + \partial_{1}F(t,q(t))Dq(t).} & {(1.107)}
   \end{equation}

   More formally, the time derivative of /F/ along a path /q/ is

   \begin{equation}
   {D(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = (DF \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\, D\Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.108)}
   \end{equation}

   Because /F/ depends only on time and coordinates, we have

   \begin{equation}
   {DF \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \lbrack\partial_{0}F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack,\partial_{1}F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack\rbrack.} & {(1.109)}
   \end{equation}



   So we need only the first two components of /D/Γ[/q/],

   \begin{equation}
   {(D\Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)(t) = (1,Dq(t),D^{2}q(t),\ldots),} & {(1.110)}
   \end{equation}

   to form the product

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {D(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)} & {= \partial_{0}F
   \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack + (\partial_{1}F \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack)Dq} & \\
   & {= (\partial_{0}F + (\partial_{1}F)\overset{˙}{Q}) \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack,} & {(1.111)} \end{equation}

   where

   $\overset{˙}{Q} = I_{2}$

   is a selector function:[fn:70]

   $c = \overset{˙}{Q}(a,b,c)$

   , so

   $Dq = \overset{˙}{Q} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$

   .

   The function

   \begin{equation}
   {D_{t}F = \partial_{0}F + (\partial_{1}F)\overset{˙}{Q}} & {(1.112)}
   \end{equation}

   is called the /total time derivative/ of /F/ ; it is a function of three
   arguments: the time, the generalized coordinates, and the generalized
   velocities.

   In general, the total time derivative of a local-tuple function /F/ is that
   function /D_{t}F/ that when composed with a local-tuple path is the time
   derivative of the composition of the function /F/ with the same local-tuple
   path:

   \begin{equation}
   {D_{t}F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = D(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.113)}
   \end{equation}

   The total time derivative /D_{t}F/ is explicitly given by

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {D_{t}F(t,q,v,a,\ldots) =} &
   {\partial_{0}F(t,q,v,a,\ldots)} & \\
   & {+ \partial_{1}F(t,q,v,a,\ldots)v} & \\
   & {+ \partial_{2}F(t,q,v,a,\ldots)a + \cdots,} & {(1.114)} \end{equation}

   where we take as many terms as needed to exhaust the arguments of /F/.

   *Exercise 1.26: Properties of* /D_{t}/

   The total time derivative /D_{t}F/ is not the derivative of the function /F/.
   Nevertheless, the total time derivative shares many properties with the
   derivative. Demonstrate that /D_{t}/ has the following properties for
   local-tuple functions /F/ and /G/, number /c/, and a function /H/ with domain
   containing the range of /G/.



   *a.* /D_{t}/(/F/ + /G/) = /D_{t}F/ + /D_{t}G/

   *b.* /D_{t}/(/cF/) = /cD_{t}F/

   *c.* /D_{t}/(/FG/) = /FD_{t}G/ + (/D_{t}F/)/G/

   *d.* /D_{t}/(/H/ ∘ /G/) = (/DH/ ∘ /G/)/D_{t}G/

** Adding total time derivatives to Lagrangians
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: adding-total-time-derivatives-to-lagrangians
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Consider two Lagrangians /L/ and /L/′ that differ by the addition of a total
   time derivative of a function /F/ that depends only on the time and the
   coordinates

   \begin{equation}
   {L\prime = L + D_{t}F.} & {(1.115)}
   \end{equation}

   The corresponding action integral is

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {S\prime\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2})} & {=
   {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{L\prime \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack}}} & \\
   & {= {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{(L + D_{t}F) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack}}} & \\
   & {= {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack +
   {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{D(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)}}}}} & \\
   & {= S\lbrack q\rbrack(t_{1},t_{2}) + (F \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack)|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}.} & {(1.116)} \end{equation}

   The variational principle states that the action integral along a realizable
   trajectory is stationary with respect to variations of the trajectory that
   leave the configuration at the endpoints fixed. The action integrals
   /S/[/q/](/t/_{1}, /t/_{2}) and /S/′[/q/](/t/_{1}, /t/_{2}) differ by a term

   \begin{equation}
   {(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} = F(t_{2},q(t_{2})) - F(t_{1},q(t_{1}))} & {(1.117)}
   \end{equation}

   that depends only on the coordinates and time at the endpoints and these are
   not allowed to vary. Thus, if /S/[/q/](/t/_{1}, /t/_{2}) is stationary for a
   path, then /S/′[/q/](/t/_{1}, /t/_{2}) will also be stationary. So either
   Lagrangian can be used to distinguish the realizable paths.

   The addition of a total time derivative to a Lagrangian does not affect
   whether the action is stationary for a given path. So if we have two
   Lagrangians that differ by a total time derivative, the corresponding
   Lagrange equations are equivalent in that the same paths satisfy each.
   Moreover, the additional terms introduced into the action by the total time
   derivative appear only in the endpoint condition and thus do not affect the
   Lagrange equations derived from the variation of the action, so the Lagrange
   equations are the same. The Lagrange equations are not changed by the
   addition of a total time derivative to a Lagrangian.

   *Exercise 1.27: Lagrange equations for total time derivatives*

   Let /F/ (/t/, /q/) be a function of /t/ and /q/ only, with total time
   derivative

   \begin{equation}
   {D_{t}F = \partial_{0}F + (\partial_{1}F)\overset{˙}{Q}.} & {(1.118)}
   \end{equation}

   Show explicitly that the Lagrange equations for /D_{t}F/ are identically
   zero, and thus that the addition of /D_{t}F/ to a Lagrangian does not affect
   the Lagrange equations.

   The driven pendulum provides a nice illustration of adding total time
   derivatives to Lagrangians. The equation of motion for the driven pendulum
   (see [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]),

   \begin{equation}
   {ml^{2}D^{2}\theta(t) + ml(g + D^{2}y_{s}(t))\,\sin\theta(t) = 0,} & {(1.119)}
   \end{equation}

   has an interesting and suggestive interpretation: it is the same as the
   equation of motion of an undriven pendulum, except that the acceleration of
   gravity /g/ is augmented by the acceleration of the pivot /D/^{2}/y_{s}/.
   This intuitive interpretation was not apparent in the Lagrangian derived as
   the difference of the kinetic and potential energies in
   [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]. However, we can write an
   alternate Lagrangian with the same equation of motion that is as easy to
   interpret as the equation of motion:

   \begin{equation}
   {L\prime(t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}) = \frac{1}{2}ml^{2}{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + ml(g + D^{2}y_{s}(t))\,\cos\theta.} & {(1.120)}
   \end{equation}

   With this Lagrangian it is apparent that the effect of the accelerating pivot
   is to modify the acceleration of gravity. Note, however, that it is not the
   difference of the kinetic and potential energies. Let's compare the two
   Lagrangians for the driven pendulum. The difference Δ/L/ = /L/ − /L/′ is

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {\Delta L(t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}) =} &
   {\frac{1}{2}m{(Dy_{s}(t))}^{2} + mlDy_{s}(t)\overset{˙}{\theta}\,\sin\theta}
   & \\
   & {- gmy_{s}(t) - mlD^{2}y_{s}(t)\,\cos\theta.} & {(1.121)} \end{equation}

   The two terms in Δ/L/ that depend on neither /θ/ nor

   $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

   do not affect the equations of motion. The remaining two terms are the total
   time derivative of the function /F/ (/t/, /θ/) = −/mlDy_{s}/(/t/) cos /θ/,
   which does not depend on

   $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

   . The addition of such terms to a Lagrangian does not affect the equations of
   motion.

** Properties of total time derivatives

   :END:
   If the local-tuple function /G/, with arguments (/t/, /q/, /v/), is the total
   time derivative of a function /F/, with arguments (/t/, /q/), then /G/ must
   have certain properties.

   From equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.112][1.112]]), we see that /G/
   must be linear in the generalized velocities

   \begin{equation}
   {G(t,q,v) = G_{0}(t,q,v) + G_{1}(t,q,v)\, v} & {(1.122)}
   \end{equation}

   where neither /G/_{1} nor /G/_{0} depends on the generalized velocities:
   ∂_{2}/G/_{1} = ∂_{2}/G/_{0} = 0.

   If /G/ is the total time derivative of /F/ then /G/_{1} = ∂_{1}/F/ and
   /G/_{0} = ∂_{0}/F/, so

   \begin{equation}
   {\partial_{0}G_{1} = \partial_{0}\partial_{1}F} & \\
   {\partial_{1}G_{0} = \partial_{1}\partial_{0}F.} & {(1.123)}
   \end{equation}

   The partial derivative with respect to the time argument does not have
   structure, so ∂_{0}∂_{1}/F/ = ∂_{1}∂_{0}/F/. So if /G/ is the total time
   derivative of /F/ then

   \begin{equation}
   {\partial_{0}G_{1} = \partial_{1}G_{0}.} & {(1.124)}
   \end{equation}

   Furthermore, /G/_{1} = ∂_{1}/F/, so

   \begin{equation}
   {\partial_{1}G_{1} = \partial_{1}\partial_{1}F.} & {(1.125)}
   \end{equation}

   If there is more than one degree of freedom these partials are actually
   structures of partial derivatives with respect to each coordinate. The
   partial derivatives with respect to two different coordinates must be the
   same independent of the order of the differentiation. So ∂_{1}/G/_{1} must be
   symmetric.

   Note that we have not shown that these conditions are sufficient for
   determining that a function is a total time derivative, only that they are
   necessary.



   *Exercise 1.28: Identifying total time derivatives*

   For each of the following functions, either show that it is not a total time
   derivative or produce a function from which it can be derived.

   *a.* /G/(/t/, /x/, /v/_{/x/}) = /mv_{x}/

   *b.* /G/(/t/, /x/, /v_{x}/) = /mv_{x}/ cos /t/

   *c.* /G/(/t/, /x/, /v_{x}/) = /v_{x}/ cos /t/ − /x/ sin /t/

   *d.* /G/(/t/, /x/, /v_{x}/) = /v_{x}/ cos /t/ + /x/ sin /t/

   *e.* /G/(/t/; /x/, /y/; /v_{x}/, /v_{y}/) = 2(/xv_{x}/ + /yv_{y}/) cos /t/ −
   (/x/^{2} + /y/^{2}) sin /t/

   *f.* /G/(/t/; /x/, /y/; /v_{x}/, /v_{y}/) = 2(/xv_{x}/ + /yv_{y}/) cos /t/ −
   (/x/^{2} + /y/^{2}) sin /t/ + /y/^{3}/v_{x}/ + /xv_{y}/

   *Exercise 1.29: Galilean invariance of kinetic energy*

   We have taken the kinetic energy of a set of particles indexed by /α/ to be

   $\sum_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}^{2}}$

   . This form is Galilean invariant.

   *a.* Start with a Lagrangian for free particles, which is only the sum of
   their kinetic energies:

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t,x,v) = {\sum\limits_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}^{2}.}}} & {(1.126)}
   \end{equation}

   Carry out a coordinate transformation from old to new coordinates that
   consists of a shift and a uniform translation

   \begin{equation}
   {x_{\alpha} = x_{\alpha}^{\prime} + \Delta x + \Delta vt.} & {(1.127)}
   \end{equation}

   Derive the Lagrangian in new coordinates.

   *b.* The new Lagrangian can be put in the form

   $\sum_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}{(v_{\alpha}^{\prime})}^{2}}$

   plus some additional terms. Show that the additional terms are a total time
   derivative.

   Thus the kinetic energy can be taken to be

   $\sum_{\alpha}{\frac{1}{2}m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}^{2}}$

   in any uniformly moving coordinate system.

* 1.7 Evolution of Dynamical State
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6b
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  Lagrange's equations are ordinary differential equations that the path must
  satisfy. They can be used to test if a proposed path is a realizable path of
  the system. However, we can also use them to develop a path, starting with
  initial conditions.

  The /state/ of a system is defined to be the information that must be
  specified for the subsequent evolution to be determined. Remember our juggler:
  he or she must throw the pin in a certain way for it to execute the desired
  motion. The juggler has control of the initial position and orientation of the
  pin, and the initial velocity and spin of the pin. Our experience with
  juggling and similar systems suggests that the initial configuration and the
  rate of change of the configuration are sufficient to determine the subsequent
  motion. Other systems may require higher derivatives of the configuration.

  For Lagrangians that are written in terms of a set of generalized coordinates
  and velocities we have shown that Lagrange's equations are second-order
  ordinary differential equations. If the differential equations can be solved
  for the highest-order derivatives and if the differential equations satisfy
  the Lipschitz conditions,[fn:71] then there is a unique solution to the
  initial-value problem: given values of the solution and the lower derivatives
  of the solution at a particular moment, there is a unique solution function.
  Given irredundant coordinates the Lagrange equations satisfy these
  conditions.[fn:72] Thus a trajectory is determined by the generalized
  coordinates and the generalized velocities at any time. This is the
  information required to specify the dynamical state.

  A complete local description of a path consists of the path and all of its
  derivatives at a moment. The complete local description of a path can be
  reconstructed from an initial segment of the local tuple, given a prescription
  for computing higher-order derivatives of the path in terms of lower-order
  derivatives. The state of the system is specified by that initial segment of
  the local tuple from which the rest of the complete local description can be
  deduced. The complete local description gives us the path near that moment.
  Actually, all we need is a rule for computing the next higher derivative; we
  can get all the rest from this. Assume that the state of a system is given by
  the tuple (/t/, /q/, /v/). If we are given a prescription for computing the
  acceleration /a/ = /A/(/t/, /q/, /v/), then

  \begin{equation}
  {D^{2}q = A \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack,} & {(1.128)}
  \end{equation}

  and we have as a consequence

  \begin{equation}
  {D^{3}q = D(A \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = D_{t}A \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack,} & {(1.129)}
  \end{equation}

  and so on. So the higher-derivative components of the local tuple are given by
  functions

  $D_{t}A,\,\,\, D_{t}^{2}A,\ldots$

  . Each of these functions depends on lower-derivative components of the local
  tuple. All we need to deduce the path from the state is a function that gives
  the next-higher derivative component of the local description from the state.
  We use the Lagrange equations to find this function.

  First, we expand the Lagrange equations

  $\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = D(\partial_{2}L \circ
  \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)$

  so that the second derivative appears explicitly:

  $\begin{array}{l} {\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack}
  \\ {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \partial_{0}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
  q\rbrack + (\partial_{1}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\, Dq +
  (\partial_{2}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\, D^{2}q.}
  \\ \end{equation}$

  Solving this system for /D/^{2}/q/, one obtains the generalized acceleration
  along a solution path /q/:

  $\begin{array}{l} {D^{2}q =}
  \\ {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,{\lbrack\partial_{2}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
  q\rbrack\rbrack}^{- 1}\lbrack\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack -
  (\partial_{1}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\, Dq -
  \partial_{0}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack\rbrack} \end{equation}$

  where [∂_{2}∂_{2}/L/ ∘ Γ] is a structure that can be represented by a
  symmetric square matrix, so we can compute its inverse.[fn:73] The function
  that gives the acceleration is

  \begin{equation}
  {A = {(\partial_{2}\partial_{2}L)}^{- 1}\lbrack\partial_{1}L - \partial_{0}\partial_{2}L - (\partial_{1}\partial_{2}L)\overset{˙}{Q}\rbrack,} & {(1.130)}
  \end{equation}

  where

  $\overset{˙}{Q} = I_{2}$

  is the velocity component selector.



  That initial segment of the local tuple that specifies the state is called the
  local state tuple, or, more simply, the state tuple.[fn:74]

  We can express the function that gives the acceleration as a function of the
  state tuple as the following procedure. It takes a procedure that computes the
  Lagrangian, and returns a procedure that takes a state tuple as its argument
  and returns the acceleration.[fn:75]

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (Lagrangian->acceleration L) (let ((P
  ((partial 2) L)) (F ((partial 1) L))) (solve-linear-left ((partial 2) P) (- F
  (+ ((partial 0) P) (* ((partial 1) P) velocity))))))
   #+end_src

  Once we have a way of computing the acceleration from the coordinates and the
  velocities, we can give a prescription for computing the derivative of the
  state as a function of the state. For the state (/t/, /q/(/t/), /Dq/(/t/)) at
  the moment /t/ the derivative of the state is (1, /Dq/(/t/), /D/^{2}/q/(/t/))
  = (1, /Dq/(/t/), /A/(/t/, /q/(/t/), /Dq/(/t/))). The procedure
  Lagrangian->state-derivative takes a Lagrangian and returns a procedure that
  takes a state and returns the derivative of the state:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (Lagrangian->state-derivative L) (let
  ((acceleration (Lagrangian->acceleration L))) (lambda (state) (up 1 (velocity
state) (acceleration state)))))
   #+end_src

  We represent a state by an up tuple of the components of that initial segment
  of the local tuple that determine the state.



  For example, the parametric state derivative for a harmonic oscillator is

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (harmonic-state-derivative m k)
  (Lagrangian->state-derivative (L-harmonic m k))) ((harmonic-state-derivative
'm 'k) (up 't (up 'x 'y) (up 'v_x 'v_y))) (up 1 (up v_x v_y) (up (/ (* -1 k x)
m) (/ (* -1 k y) m)))
   #+end_src

  The Lagrange equations are a second-order system of differential equations
  that constrain realizable paths /q/. We can use the state derivative to
  express the Lagrange equations as a first-order system of differential
  equations that constrain realizable coordinate paths /q/ and velocity paths
  /v/:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((Lagrange-equations-first-order L) q v) (let
  ((state-path (qv->state-path q v))) (- (D state-path) (compose
  (Lagrangian->state-derivative L) state-path)))) (define ((qv->state-path q v)
t) (up t (q t) (v t)))
   #+end_src

  For example, we can find the first-order form of the equations of motion of a
  two-dimensional harmonic oscillator:

   #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression (((Lagrange-equations-first-order
  (L-harmonic 'm 'k)) (up (literal-function 'x) (literal-function 'y)) (up
  (literal-function 'v_x) (literal-function 'v_y))) 't))
   #+end_src

  $$\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \begin{pmatrix} {Dx(t) - v_{x}(t)} {Dy(t) - v_{y}(t)}
  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} {\frac{kx(t)}{m} + Dv_{x}(t)}
  \\ {\frac{ky(t)}{m} + Dv_{y}(t)} \end{pmatrix} \end{pmatrix}$$



  #+caption: *Figure 1.6* The input to the system derivative is the state.
  The function /A/ gives the acceleration as a function of the components that
  determine the state. The output of the system derivative is the derivative of
  the state. The integrator takes the derivative of the state as its input and
  produces the integrated state, starting at the initial conditions. Notice how
  the second-order system is put into first-order form by the routing of the
  /Dq/(/t/) components in the system derivative. [[file:images/Art_P208.jpg]]

  The zero in the first element of the structure of the Lagrange equations
  residuals is just the tautology that time advances uniformly: the time
  function is just the identity, so its derivative is one and the residual is

  the derivative of the coordinate path. The equations in the third element give
  the rate of change of the velocity in terms of the applied forces.

** Numerical integration

   :END:
   A set of first-order ordinary differential equations that give the state
   derivative in terms of the state can be integrated to find the state path
   that emanates from a given initial state. Numerical integrators find
   approximate solutions of such differential equations by a process illustrated
   in [[file:chapter001.html#Fig_1-6][figure 1.6]]. The state derivative
   produced by Lagrangian->state-derivative can be used by a package that
   numerically integrates systems of first-order ordinary differential
   equations.

   The procedure state-advancer can be used to find the state of a system at a
   specified time, given an initial state, which includes the initial time, and
   a parametric state-derivative procedure.[fn:76] For example, to advance the
   state of a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator we write[fn:77]

    #+begin_src scheme
((state-advancer harmonic-state-derivative 2.0 1.0)
   (up 1.0 (up 1.0 2.0) (up 3.0 4.0)) 10.0 1.0e-12) (up 11.0 (up
3.7127916645844437 5.420620823651583) (up 1.6148030925459782
1.8189103724750855))
    #+end_src

   The arguments to state-advancer are a parametric state derivative,
   harmonic-state-derivative, and the state-derivative parameters (mass 2 and
   spring constant 1). A procedure is returned that takes an initial state, (up
   1 (up 1 2) (up 3 4)); a time increment, 10; and a relative error tolerance,
   1.0e-12. The output is an approximation to the state at the specified final
   time.

   Consider the driven pendulum described in
   [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]] with a periodic drive. We
   choose /y_{s}/(/t/) = /A/ cos /ωt/.

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((periodic-drive amplitude frequency phase) t)
   (* amplitude (cos (+ (* frequency t) phase)))) (define
   (L-periodically-driven-pendulum m l g A omega) (let ((ys (periodic-drive A
omega 0))) (L-pend m l g ys)))
    #+end_src



   Lagrange's equation for this system is

    #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression (((Lagrange-equations
   (L-periodically-driven-pendulum 'm 'l 'g 'A 'omega)) (literal-function

    #+end_src

   $$D^{2}\theta(t)l^{2}m - \cos(\omega t)\,\sin\,(\theta(t))\, Alm\omega^{2} +
   \sin\,(\theta(t))\, glm$$

   The parametric state derivative for the periodically driven pendulum is

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (pend-state-derivative m l g A omega)
   (Lagrangian->state-derivative (L-periodically-driven-pendulum m l g A

   $$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ \overset{˙}{\theta} {\frac{A\omega^{2}\cos\,(\omega
   t)\,\sin\,(\theta)}{l} - \frac{g\sin\,(\theta)}{l}} \end{pmatrix}$$

   To examine the evolution of the driven pendulum we need a mechanism that
   evolves a system for some interval while monitoring aspects of the system as
   it evolves. The procedure evolve provides this service, using state-advancer
   repeatedly to advance the state to the required moments. The procedure evolve
   takes a parametric state derivative and its parameters and returns a
   procedure that evolves the system from a specified initial state to a number
   of other times, monitoring some aspect of the state at those times. To
   generate a plot of the angle versus time we make a monitor procedure that
   generates the plot as the evolution proceeds:[fn:78]

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((monitor-theta win) state) (let ((theta
   ((principal-value :pi) (coordinate state)))) (plot-point win (time state)
   theta))) (define plot-win (frame 0.0 100.0 :-pi :pi)) ((evolve

   ;final time 1.0e-13) ;local error tolerance
    #+end_src

   [[#Fig_1-7][Figure 1.7]] shows the angle /θ/ versus time for a couple of
   orbits for the driven pendulum. The initial conditions for the two runs are
   the same except that in one the bob is given a tiny velocity equal to
   10^{−10}m/s, about one atom width per second. The initial segments of the two
   orbits are indistinguishable. After about 75 seconds the two orbits diverge
   and become completely different. This extreme sensitivity to tiny changes in
   initial conditions is characteristic of what is called /chaotic behavior/.
   Later, we will investigate this example further, using other tools such as
   Lyapunov exponents, phase space, and Poincaré sections.



   #+caption: *Figure 1.7* Orbits of the driven pendulum. The angle /θ/ is

   of as being wound around a cylinder. The upper plot shows the results of a
   simulation with initial conditions /θ/ = 1 and ¶ $\overset{˙}{\theta} = 0$ ¶
   . The orbit oscillates for a while, then circulates, then resumes
   oscillating. In the lower plot we show the result for a slightly different
   initial angular velocity, ¶ $\overset{˙}{\theta} = 10^{- 10}$ ¶ . The initial
   behavior is indistinguishable from the top figure, but the two trajectories
   become uncorrelated after the transition between oscillation and circulation.
   This extreme sensitivity to initial conditions is characteristic of systems
   with chaotic behavior. [[file:images/Art_P211.jpg]]



   *Exercise 1.30: Orbits in a central potential*

   A Lagrangian for planar motion of a particle of mass /m/ in a central field
   with potential energy /V/ (/r/) = −/βr^{α}/ is

   $L(t;r,\theta;\overset{˙}{r},\overset{˙}{\theta}) =
   \frac{1}{2}m({\overset{˙}{r}}^{2} + {(r\overset{˙}{\theta})}^{2}) + V(r).$

   *a.* Write a program to evolve the motion of a particle subject to this
   Lagrangian and display the orbit in the plane.

   *b.* Evolve this system with /α/ = +2 (harmonic oscillator). Observe that it
   describes an ellipse with its center at the origin, for a wide variety of
   initial conditions.

   *c.* Evolve this system with /α/ = −1 (Newtonian gravity). Observe that it
   describes an ellipse with a focus at the origin, for a wide variety of
   initial conditions.

   *d.* Evolve this system with /α/ = +1/4. Observe that it describes a trefoil
   with its center at the origin.

   *Exercise 1.31: Foucault pendulum evolution*

   If a Foucault pendulum is erected at the North Pole, it will precess exactly
   once in a day. If it is erected at the Equator it will not precess at all. It
   is widely reported that the precession rate is proportional to the cosine of
   the colatitude.

   *a.* Evolve the Foucault pendulum, using the Lagrangian you constructed in
   [[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-25][exercise 1.25]] on
   [[file:chapter001.html#p62][page 62]]. You should look at the precession
   angle /λ/ as a function of time.

   *b.* How does the rate of precession compare to the predicted rate? You
   should expect to see an error caused by the fact that the local vertical, as
   defined by a plumb bob, is not directed to the center of the Earth.

   *c.* Let Δ/ϕ/ be the angle between the local vertical and the direction to
   the center of the Earth. How does the precession rate compare to the
   predicted precession rate with the colatitude corrected to /ϕ/ − Δ/ϕ/? Is
   this perfect?

* 1.8 Conserved Quantities
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6c
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  A function of the state of the system that is constant along a solution path
  is called a /conserved quantity/ or a /constant of motion/.[fn:79] If /C/ is a
  conserved quantity, then

  \begin{equation}
  {D(C \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = D_{t}C \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = 0} & {(1.131)}
  \end{equation}



  for solution paths /q/. In this section, we will investigate systems with
  symmetry and find that symmetries are associated with conserved quantities.
  For instance, linear momentum is conserved in a system with translational
  symmetry, angular momentum is conserved if there is rotational symmetry,
  energy is conserved if the system does not depend on the origin of time. We
  first consider systems for which a coordinate system can be chosen that
  expresses the symmetry naturally, and later discuss systems for which no
  coordinate system can be chosen that simultaneously expresses all symmetries.

*** 1.8.1 Conserved Momenta

    If a Lagrangian /L/(/t/, /q/, /v/) does not depend on some particular
    coordinate /q^{i}/, then

    \begin{equation}
    {{(\partial_{1}L)}_{i} = 0,} & {(1.132)}
    \end{equation}

    and the corresponding /i/th component of the Lagrange equations is

    \begin{equation}
    {{(D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack))}_{i} = 0.} & {(1.133)}
    \end{equation}

    The derivative of a component is equal to the component of the derivative,
    so this is the same as

    \begin{equation}
    {D({(\partial_{2}L)}_{i} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = 0,} & {(1.134)}
    \end{equation}

    and we can see that

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{P}_{i} = {(\partial_{2}L)}_{i}} & {(1.135)}
    \end{equation}

    is a conserved quantity. The function

    $\mathcal{P}$

    is called the /momentum state function/. The value of the momentum state
    function is the /generalized momentum/. We refer to the /i/th component of
    the generalized momentum as the momentum /conjugate/ to the /i/th
    coordinate.[fn:80] The momenta depend on the choice of Lagrangian used to
    describe the system.[fn:81] A generalized coordinate component that does not
    appear explicitly in the Lagrangian is called a /cyclic coordinate/. The
    generalized momentum component conjugate to any cyclic coordinate is a
    constant of the motion. Its value is constant along realizable paths; it may
    have different values on different paths. As we will see, momentum is an
    important quantity even when it is not conserved.

    Given the coordinate path /q/ and the Lagrangian /L/, the momentum path /p/
    is

    \begin{equation}
    {p = \partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \mathcal{P} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack,} & {(1.136)}
    \end{equation}

    with components

    \begin{equation}
    {p_{i} = \mathcal{P}_{i} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.137)}
    \end{equation}

    The momentum path is well defined for any path /q/. If the path is
    realizable and the Lagrangian does not depend on /q^{i}/, then /p_{i}/ is a
    constant function

    \begin{equation}
    {Dp_{i} = 0.} & {(1.138)}
    \end{equation}

    The constant value of /p_{i}/ may be different for different trajectories.

** Examples of conserved momenta
   :PROPERTIES:

   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   The free-particle Lagrangian

   $L(t,x,v) = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$

   is independent of /x/. So the momentum state function,

   $\mathcal{P}(t,q,v) = mv$

   , is conserved along realizable paths. The momentum path /p/ for the
   coordinate path /q/ is

   $p(t) = \mathcal{P} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack(t) = m\, Dq(t)$

   . For a realizable path /Dp/(/t/) = 0. For the free particle the usual linear
   momentum is conserved for realizable paths.

   For a particle in a central force field
   ([[file:chapter001.html#h1-6a][section 1.6]]), the Lagrangian

   $L(t;r,\varphi;\overset{˙}{r},\overset{˙}{\varphi}) =
   \frac{1}{2}m({\overset{˙}{r}}^{2} + r^{2}{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}) - V(r)$

   depends on /r/ but is independent of /φ/. The momentum state function is

   $\mathcal{P}\left( {t;r,\varphi;\overset{˙}{r},\overset{˙}{\varphi}} \right)
   = \lbrack m\overset{˙}{r},mr^{2}\overset{˙}{\varphi}\rbrack.$

   It has two components. The first component, the “radial momentum,” is not
   conserved. The second component, the “angular momentum,” is conserved along
   any solution trajectory.



   If the central-potential problem had been expressed in rectangular
   coordinates, then all of the coordinates would have appeared in the
   Lagrangian. In that case there would not be any obvious conserved quantities.
   Nevertheless, the motion of the system does not depend on the choice of
   coordinates, so the angular momentum is still conserved.

   We see that there is great advantage in making a judicious choice for the
   coordinate system. If we can choose the coordinates so that a symmetry of the
   system is reflected in the Lagrangian by the absence of some coordinate
   component, then the existence of a corresponding conserved quantity will be
   evident.[fn:82]

*** 1.8.2 Energy Conservation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-8-2

    Momenta are conserved by the motion if the Lagrangian does not depend on the
    corresponding coordinate. There is another constant of the motion, the
    energy, if the Lagrangian

    $L(t,q,\overset{˙}{q})$

    does not depend explicitly on the time: ∂_{0}/L/ = 0.

    Consider the time derivative of the Lagrangian along a solution path /q/:

    \begin{equation}
    {D(L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = \partial_{0}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack + (\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)Dq + (\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)D^{2}q.} & {(1.139)}
    \end{equation}

    Using Lagrange's equations to rewrite the second term yields

    \begin{equation}
    {D(L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = (\partial_{0}L) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack + D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)Dq + (\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)D^{2}q.} & {(1.140)}
    \end{equation}

    Isolating ∂_{0}/L/ and combining the other terms we get

    $$\begin{array}{lll} {(\partial_{0}L) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack} & {= D(L
    \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - D((\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
    q\rbrack)Dq)} & \\
    & {= D(L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - D((\partial_{2}L \circ

    & {= D((L - \mathcal{P}\overset{˙}{Q}) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack),} &
    {(1.141)} \end{equation}

    where, as before,

    $\overset{˙}{Q}$

    selects the velocity from the state. So we see that if ∂_{0}/L/ = 0 then

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{P}\overset{˙}{Q} - L} & {(1.142)}
    \end{equation}



    is conserved along realizable paths. The function /ℰ/ is called the /energy
    state function/.[fn:83] The energy state function for a system depends on
    the choice of Lagrangian used to describe the system.[fn:84] Let /E/ = /ℰ/ ∘
    Γ[/q/] denote the energy function on the path /q/. The energy function has a
    constant value along any realizable trajectory if the Lagrangian has no
    explicit time dependence; the energy /E/ may have a different value for
    different trajectories. A system that has no explicit time dependence is
    called /autonomous/.

    Given a Lagrangian procedure L, we may construct the energy function:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define (Lagrangian->energy L) (let ((P ((partial 2) L))) (- (* P velocity) L)))
     #+end_src

** Energy in terms of kinetic and potential energies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: energy-in-terms-of-kinetic-and-potential-energies
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   In some cases the energy can be written as the sum of kinetic and potential
   energies. Suppose the system is composed of particles with rectangular
   coordinates *x*_{/α/}, the movement of which may be subject to constraints,
   and that these rectangular coordinates are some functions of the generalized
   coordinates /q/ and possibly time /t/: *x*_{/α/} = /f_{α}/(/t/, /q/). We form
   the Lagrangian as /L/ = /T/ − /V/ and compute the kinetic energy in terms of
   /q/ by writing the rectangular velocities in terms of the generalized
   velocities:

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathbf{v}_{\alpha} = \partial_{0}f_{\alpha}(t,q) + \partial_{1}f_{\alpha}(t,q)v.} & {(1.143)}
   \end{equation}

   The kinetic energy is

   \begin{equation}
   {T\left( {t,q,v} \right) = \frac{1}{2}{\sum_{\alpha}{m_{\alpha}v_{\alpha}^{2},}}} & {(1.144)}
   \end{equation}

   where /v_{α}/ is the magnitude of *v*_{/α/}.

   If the /f/_{/α/} functions do not depend explicitly on time (∂_{0}/f_{α}/ =
   0), then the rectangular velocities are homogeneous functions of the
   generalized velocities of degree 1, and /T/ is a homogeneous function of the
   generalized velocities of degree 2, because it is formed by summing the
   square of homogeneous functions of degree 1. If /T/ is a homogeneous function
   of degree 2 in the generalized velocities then

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{P}\overset{˙}{Q} = \left( {\partial_{2}T} \right)\overset{˙}{Q} = 2T,} & {(1.145)}
   \end{equation}

   where the second equality follows from Euler's theorem on homogeneous
   functions.[fn:85] The energy state function is

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{E} = \mathcal{P}\overset{˙}{Q} - L = 2T - T + V.} & {(1.146)}
   \end{equation}

   So if /f_{α}/ is independent of time, the energy function can be rewritten

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{E} = 2T - T + V = T + V.} & {(1.147)}
   \end{equation}

   Notice that if /V/ depends on time the energy is still the sum of the kinetic
   energy and potential energy, but the energy is not conserved.

   The energy state function is always well defined, whether or not it can be
   written in the form /T/ + /V/, and whether or not it is conserved along
   realizable paths.

   *Exercise 1.32: Time-dependent constraints*

   An analogous result holds when the /f_{α}/ depend explicitly on time.

   *a.* Show that in this case the kinetic energy contains terms that are linear
   in the generalized velocities.

   *b.* By adding a total time derivative, show that the Lagrangian can be
   written in the form /L/ = /A/ − /B/, where /A/ is a homogeneous quadratic
   form in the generalized velocities and /B/ is independent of velocity.

   *c.* Show, using Euler's theorem, that the energy function is /ℰ/ = /A/+/B/.

   An example in which terms that were linear in the velocity were removed from
   the Lagrangian by adding a total time derivative has already been given: the
   driven pendulum.



   *Exercise 1.33: Falling off a log*

   A particle of mass /m/ slides off a horizontal cylinder of radius /R/ in a
   uniform gravitational field with acceleration /g/. If the particle starts
   close to the top of the cylinder with zero initial speed, with what angular
   velocity does it leave the cylinder? Use the method of incorporating
   constraint forces that we introduced in
   [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]], together with conservation
   of energy.

*** 1.8.3 Central Forces in Three Dimensions
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:
    One important physical system is the motion of a particle in a central field
    in three dimensions, with an arbitrary potential energy /V/ (/r/) depending
    only on the radius. We will describe this system in spherical coordinates
    /r/, /θ/, and /φ/, where /θ/ is the colatitude and /φ/ is the longitude. The
    kinetic energy has three terms:

    $$T(t;r,\theta,\varphi;\overset{˙}{r},\overset{˙}{\theta},\overset{˙}{\varphi})
    = \frac{1}{2}m({\overset{˙}{r}}^{2} + r^{2}{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} +
    r^{2}{(\sin\theta)}^{2}{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}).$$

    As a procedure:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((T3-spherical m) state) (let ((q (coordinate state)) (qdot (velocity
state))) (let ((r (ref q 0)) (theta (ref q 1)) (rdot
    (ref qdot 0)) (thetadot (ref qdot 1)) (phidot (ref qdot 2))) (* 1/2 m (+
    (square rdot) (square (* r thetadot)) (square (* r (sin theta) phidot)))))))

     #+end_src

    A Lagrangian is then formed by subtracting the potential energy:

        #+begin_src scheme
(define (L3-central m Vr) (define (Vs state) (let ((r
    (ref (coordinate state) 0))) (Vr r))) (- (T3-spherical m) Vs)) {%

        #+end_src

    Let's first look at the generalized forces (the derivatives of the
    Lagrangian with respect to the generalized coordinates). We compute these
    with a partial derivative with respect to the coordinate argument of the
    Lagrangian:

     #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression (((partial 1) (L3-central 'm
    (literal-function 'V))) (up 't (up 'r 'theta 'phi) (up 'rdot 'thetadot
'phidot))))
     #+end_src

    $$\begin{bmatrix} {m{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}r\,{(\sin\,(\theta))}^{2} +
    mr{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} - DV\,(r)}
    \\ {m{\overset{˙}{\varphi}}^{2}r^{2}\cos\,(\theta)\,\sin\,(\theta)} 0
    \\ \end{bmatrix}$$

    The /φ/ component of the force is zero because /φ/ does not appear in the
    Lagrangian (it is a cyclic coordinate). The corresponding momentum component
    is conserved. Compute the momenta:

     #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression (((partial 2) (L3-central 'm
    (literal-function 'V))) (up 't (up 'r 'theta 'phi) (up 'rdot 'thetadot
'phidot))))
     #+end_src

    $$\begin{bmatrix} {m\overset{˙}{r}} {mr^{2}\overset{˙}{\theta}}
    \\ {mr^{2}\overset{˙}{\varphi}{(\sin\,(\theta))}^{2}} \end{bmatrix}$$

    The momentum conjugate to /φ/ is conserved. This is the /z/ component of the
    angular momentum

    $\overset{\rightarrow}{r} \times (m\overset{\rightarrow}{v})$

    , for vector position

    $\overset{\rightarrow}{r}$

    and linear momentum

    $m\overset{\rightarrow}{v}$

    . We can show this by writing the /z/ component of the angular momentum in
    spherical coordinates:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((ang-mom-z m) rectangular-state) (let ((xyz
    (coordinate rectangular-state)) (v (velocity rectangular-state))) (ref
    (cross-product xyz (* m v)) 2))) (define (s->r spherical-state) (let ((q
    (coordinate spherical-state))) (let ((r (ref q 0)) (theta (ref q 1)) (phi
    (ref q 2))) (let ((x (* r (sin theta) (cos phi))) (y (* r (sin theta) (sin
phi))) (z (* r (cos theta)))) (up x y z)))))
     #+end_src

        #+begin_src scheme
(show-expression ((compose (ang-mom-z 'm) (F->C s->r)) (up 't (up 'r 'theta
'phi) (up 'rdot 'thetadot 'phidot)))) {%

        #+end_src

    $$mr^{2}\overset{˙}{\varphi}{(\sin\,(\theta))}^{2}$$

    The choice of the /z/-axis is arbitrary, so the conservation of any
    component of the angular momentum implies the conservation of all
    components. Thus the total angular momentum is conserved. We can choose the
    /z/-axis so all of the angular momentum is in the /z/ component. Since

    $\overset{\rightarrow}{x} \cdot (\overset{\rightarrow}{x} \times
    \overset{\rightarrow}{v}) = \overset{\rightarrow}{v} \cdot
    (\overset{\rightarrow}{x} \times \overset{\rightarrow}{x}) = 0$

    , the motion is confined to the plane perpendicular to the angular momentum:
    /θ/ = /π//2, and

    $\overset{˙}{\theta} = 0$

    . Planar motion in a central-force field was discussed in
    [[file:chapter001.html#h1-6a][section 1.6]].

    We can also see that the energy state function computed from the Lagrangian
    for a central field is in fact /T/ + /V/ :

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-8-4

    :END:
    Consider the situation of two bodies of masses /M/_{0} and /M/_{1} in
    circular orbit about their common center of mass. What is the behavior of a
    third particle, gravitationally attracted to the other two, that must move
    in the plane of their circular orbit? Assume that the third particle has
    such small mass that we can neglect its effect on the orbits of the two
    massive particles.

    The third particle, of mass /m/, moves in a field derived from a
    time-varying gravitational potential energy. We have:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L0 m V) local) (let ((t (time local)) (q
    (coordinates local)) (v (velocities local))) (- (* 1/2 m (square v)) (V t
q))))
     #+end_src

    Let /a/ be the constant distance between the two bodies. If we put the
    center of mass at the origin of the coordinate system then the distances of
    the two particles from the origin are:

    \begin{equation}
    {a_{0} = \frac{M_{1}}{M_{0} + M_{1}}a\,\,\text{and}\,\, a_{1} = \frac{M_{0}}{M_{0} + M_{1}}a} & {(1.148)}
    \end{equation}

    Each massive particle revolves in a circle about their common center of mass
    with angular frequency Ω. The radii of the circles are the distances given
    above. Kepler's law gives the angular frequency of the orbit:

    \begin{equation}
    {\Omega^{2}a^{3} = G(M_{0} + M_{1})} & {(1.149)}
    \end{equation}

    We choose our axes so that at /t/ = 0 the body with mass /M/_{1} is on the
    positive

    $\widehat{x}$

    axis and the body with mass /M/_{0} is on the negative

    $\widehat{x}$

    axis. The gravitational potential energy function is:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((V a GM0 GM1 m) t xy) (let ((Omega (sqrt (/
    (+ GM0 GM1) (expt a 3)))) (a0 (* (/ GM1 (+ GM0 GM1)) a)) (a1 (* (/ GM0 (+
    GM0 GM1)) a))) (let ((x (ref xy 0)) (y (ref xy 1)) (x0 (* -1 a0 (cos (*
    Omega t)))) (y0 (* -1 a0 (sin (* Omega t)))) (x1 (* +1 a1 (cos (* Omega
    t)))) (y1 (* +1 a1 (sin (* Omega t))))) (let ((r0 (sqrt (+ (square (- x x0))
    (square (- y y0))))) (r1 (sqrt (+ (square (- x x1)) (square (- y y1)))))) (-
    (+ (/ (* GM0 m) r0) (/ (* GM1 m) r1)))))))
     #+end_src



    It is convenient to examine the motion of the third particle in a rotating
    coordinate system where the massive particles are fixed. We can place the
    rotating axes so that the two massive particles are on the

    $\widehat{x}\prime$

    axis, and we can choose the rotating and nonrotating axes to be coincident
    at /t/ = 0. We can transform to the rotating rectangular coordinates as we
    did on [[file:chapter001.html#p48][page 48]]. The resulting Lagrangian is
    the Lagrangian for the free particle with the addition of two gravitational
    potential energy terms:

    \begin{equation}
    {L_{r}(t;x_{r},y_{r};{\overset{˙}{x}}_{r},{\overset{˙}{y}}_{r})} & \\
    {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}m\left( {{\overset{˙}{x}}_{r}^{2} + {\overset{˙}{y}}_{r}^{2}} \right) + \frac{1}{2}m\Omega^{2}(x_{r}^{2} + y_{r}^{2}) + m\Omega(x_{r}{\overset{˙}{y}}_{r} - {\overset{˙}{x}}_{r}y_{r})} & \\
    {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, + \frac{GM_{0}m}{r_{0}} + \frac{GM_{1}m}{r_{1}}} & {(1.150)}
    \end{equation}

    where now

    $r_{0}^{2} = {(x_{r} + a_{0})}^{2} + y_{r}^{2}\,\,\text{and}\,\, r_{1}^{2} =
    \left( {x_{r} - a_{1}} \right)^{2} + y_{r}^{2}$

    . As a program we can write:

     #+begin_src scheme
(define ((LR3B m a GM0 GM1) local) (let ((q
    (coordinates local)) (qdot (velocities local)) (Omega (sqrt (/ (+ GM0 GM1)
    (expt a 3)))) (a0 (* (/ GM1 (+ GM0 GM1)) a)) (a1 (* (/ GM0 (+ GM0 GM1)) a)))
    (let ((x (ref q 0)) (y (ref q 1)) (xdot (ref qdot 0)) (ydot (ref qdot 1)))
    (let ((r0 (sqrt (+ (square (+ x a0)) (square y)))) (r1 (sqrt (+ (square (- x
    a1)) (square y))))) (+ (* 1/2 m (square qdot)) (* 1/2 m (square Omega)
    (square q)) (* m Omega (- (* x ydot) (* xdot y))) (/ (* GM0 m) r0) (/ (* GM1
m) r1))))))
     #+end_src

    Notice that the Lagrangian in rotating coordinates is independent of time.
    So the energy state function defined by this Lagrangian is a conserved
    quantity. Let's compute it. It is clearest if we express the result in terms
    of Ω, /a/_{0}, and /a/_{1}, so we make those into explicit parameters of the
    Lagrangian:

        #+begin_src scheme
(define ((LR3B1 m a0 a1 Omega GM0 GM1) local) (let
    ((q (coordinates local)) (qdot (velocities local))) (let ((x (ref q 0)) (y
    (ref q 1)) (xdot (ref qdot 0)) (ydot (ref qdot 1))) (let ((r0 (sqrt (+
    (square (+ x a0)) (square y)))) (r1 (sqrt (+ (square (- x a1)) (square
    y))))) (+ (* 1/2 m (square qdot)) (* 1/2 m (square Omega) (square q)) (* m
    Omega (- (* x ydot) (* xdot y))) (/ (* GM0 m) r0) (/ (* GM1 m) r1)))))) {%

        #+end_src

    And we compute the energy state function (with a bit of hand
    simplification):

     #+begin_src scheme
((Lagrangian->energy (LR3B1 'm 'a_0 'a_1 'Omega 'GM_0 'GM_1)) (up 't (up 'x_r
'y_r) (up 'v_r^x 'v_r^y))) (+ (* 1/2 m (expt v_r^x 2)) (* 1/2 m (expt v_r^y
2)) (/ (* -1 GM_0 m) (sqrt (+ (expt (+ x_r a_0) 2)
    (expt y_r 2)))) (/ (* -1 GM_1 m) (sqrt (+ (expt (- x_r a_1) 2) (expt y_r
2)))) (* -1/2 m (expt Omega 2) (expt x_r 2)) (* -1/2 m (expt Omega 2) (expt y_r
2)))
     #+end_src

    If we separate this into a velocity-dependent part and a
    velocity-independent part we get

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}(t;x_{r},y_{r};{\overset{˙}{x}}_{r},{\overset{˙}{y}}_{r}) = \frac{1}{2}m({\overset{˙}{x}}_{r}^{2} + {\overset{˙}{y}}_{r}^{2}) + mU_{r}(x_{r},y_{r})} & {(1.151)}
    \end{equation}

    where

    \begin{equation}
    {U_{r}(x_{r},y_{r}) = - \left( {\frac{GM_{0}}{r_{0}} + \frac{GM_{1}}{r_{1}} + \frac{1}{2}\Omega^{2}(x_{r}^{2} + y_{r}^{2})} \right).} & {(1.152)}
    \end{equation}

    This constant of motion of the restricted three-body problem is called the
    /Jacobi constant/.[fn:86] Notice that the energy function is a positive
    definite quadratic form in the components of the velocity (in rotating
    coordinates) plus a function that depends only on the rotating coordinates.
    Note that the energy state function does not have terms that are linear in
    the velocities

    ${\overset{˙}{x}}_{r}$

    and

    ${\overset{˙}{y}}_{r}$

    , although such terms appear in the Lagrangian
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.150][1.150]]).



    *Exercise 1.35: Restricted equations of motion*

    Derive the Lagrange equations for the restricted three-body problem, given

    Coriolis and centrifugal force terms in your equations of motion.

*** 1.8.5 Noether's Theorem
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-8-5
    :CLASS:    level3
    :END:
    We have seen that if a system has a symmetry and a coordinate system can be
    chosen so that the Lagrangian does not depend on the coordinate associated
    with that symmetry, then there is a conserved quantity associated with the
    symmetry. However, there are more general symmetries that no coordinate
    system can fully express. For example, motion in a central potential is
    spherically symmetric (the dynamical system is invariant under rotations
    about any axis), but the expression of the Lagrangian for the system in
    spherical coordinates exhibits symmetry around only one axis. More
    generally, a Lagrangian has a symmetry if there is a coordinate
    transformation that leaves the Lagrangian unchanged. A continuous symmetry
    is a parametric family of symmetries. Noether proved that for any continuous
    symmetry there is a conserved quantity.

    Consider a parametric coordinate transformation

    $\widetilde{F}$

    with parameter /s/:

    \begin{equation}
    {x = \widetilde{F}(s)(t,x\prime).} & {(1.153)}
    \end{equation}

    To this parametric coordinate transformation there corresponds a parametric
    state transformation

    $\widetilde{C}$

    :

    \begin{equation}
    {(t,x,v) = \widetilde{C}(s)(t,x\prime,v\prime).} & {(1.154)}
    \end{equation}

    We require that the transformation

    $\widetilde{F}(0)$

    be the identity coordinate transformation

    $x\prime = \widetilde{F}(0)(t,x\prime)$

    , and as a consequence

    $\widetilde{C}(0)$

    is the identity state transformation

    $(t,x\prime,v\prime) = \widetilde{C}(0)(t,x\prime,v\prime)$

    . The Lagrangian /L/ has a continuous symmetry corresponding to

    $\widetilde{F}$

    if it is invariant under the transformations

    \begin{equation}
    {\widetilde{L}(s) = L \circ \widetilde{C}(s) = L} & {(1.155)}
    \end{equation}

    for any /s/. The Lagrangian /L/ is the same function as the transformed
    Lagrangian

    $\widetilde{L}(s)$

    .



    That

    $\widetilde{L}(s) = L$

    for any /s/ implies

    $D\widetilde{L}(s) = 0$

    . Explicitly,

    $\widetilde{L}(s)$

    is

    \begin{equation}
    {\widetilde{L}(s)(t,x\prime,v\prime) = L(t,\widetilde{F}(s)(t,x\prime),D_{t}(\widetilde{F}(s))(t,x\prime,v\prime)),} & {(1.156)}
    \end{equation}

    where we have rewritten the velocity component of

    $\widetilde{C}(s)$

    in terms of the total time derivative. The derivative of

    $\widetilde{L}$

    is zero:

    $$\begin{array}{lll} 0 & {= D\widetilde{L}(s)(t,x\prime,v\prime)} & \\
    & {= \partial_{1}L(t,x,v)\,\,(D\widetilde{F})(s)(t,x\prime) +
    \partial_{2}L(t,x,v)\,\, D_{t}(D\widetilde{F}(s))(t,x\prime),} & {(1.157)}
    \\
    \end{equation}

    where we have used the fact that[fn:87]

    \begin{equation}
    {D_{t}(D\widetilde{F}(s)) = DG(s)\,\,\,\text{with}\,\,\, G\left( s \right) = D_{t}(\widetilde{F}(s)).} & {(1.158)}
    \end{equation}

    On a realizable path /q/ we can use the Lagrange equations to rewrite the
    first term of equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.157][1.157]]):

    $$\begin{array}{lll} {0 =} & {(D_{t}\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
    q\rbrack)\,\,((D\widetilde{F})(s) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\prime\rbrack)} & \\
    & {\, + (\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack
    q\rbrack)\,\,(D_{t}(D\widetilde{F}(s)) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\prime\rbrack).}
    & {(1.159)} \end{equation}

    For /s/ = 0 the paths /q/ and /q/′ are the same, because

    $\widetilde{F}(0)$

    is the identity, so Γ[/q/] = Γ[/q/′] and this equation becomes

    $$\begin{array}{lll} 0 & {= ((D_{t}\partial_{2}L)\,\,((D\widetilde{F})(0)) +
    (\partial_{2}L)\,\,(D_{t}(D\widetilde{F}(0)))) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack}
    & \\
    & {= D_{t}((\partial_{2}L)\,\,(D\widetilde{F}(0))) \circ \Gamma\lbrack
    q\rbrack.} & {(1.160)} \end{equation}

    Thus the state function

    $\mathcal{I}$

    ,

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{I} = (\partial_{2}L)(D\widetilde{F}(0)),} & {(1.161)}
    \end{equation}

    is conserved along solution trajectories. This conserved quantity is called
    /Noether's integral/. It is the product of the momentum and a vector
    associated with the symmetry.



** Illustration: motion in a central potential
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: illustration-motion-in-a-central-potential
   :CLASS:    level2

   For example, consider the central-potential Lagrangian in rectangular
   coordinates:

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;x,y,z;v_{x}.v_{y},v_{z})} & \\
   {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}m\,\left( v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2} + v_{z}^{2} \right) - U\left( \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}} \right),} & {(1.162)}
   \end{equation}

   and a parametric rotation /R_{z}/(/s/) about the /z/ axis

   $$\begin{matrix} {\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \\ \end{pmatrix} =
   R_{z}(s)\,\begin{pmatrix} {x\prime} {y\prime} {z\prime} \\ \end{pmatrix}
   = \begin{pmatrix} {x\prime\cos s - y\prime\sin s} \\ {x\prime\sin s +
   y\prime\cos s} {z\prime} \end{pmatrix}.} & {(1.163)} \end{matrix}$$

   The rotation is an orthogonal transformation so

   \begin{equation}
   {x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2} = {(x\prime)}^{2} + {(y\prime)}^{2} + {(z\prime)}^{2}.} & {(1.164)}
   \end{equation}

   Differentiating along a path, we get

   \begin{equation}
   {(v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}) = R_{z}(s)(v_{x}^{\prime},v_{y}^{\prime},v_{z}^{\prime}),} & {(1.165)}
   \end{equation}

   so the velocities also transform by an orthogonal transformation, and

   $v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2} + v_{z}^{2} = {(v_{x}^{\prime})}^{2} +
   {(v_{y}^{\prime})}^{2} + {(v_{z}^{\prime})}^{2}$

   . Thus

   \begin{equation}
   {L\prime(t;x\prime,y\prime,z\prime;v_{x}^{\prime},v_{y}^{\prime},v_{z}^{\prime})} & \\
   {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}m\,\left( {{(v_{x}^{\prime})}^{2} + {(v_{y}^{\prime})}^{2} + {(v_{z}^{\prime})}^{2}} \right)} & \\
   {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, - U\left( \sqrt{{(x\prime)}^{2} + {(y\prime)}^{2} + {(z\prime)}^{2}} \right),} & {(1.166)}
   \end{equation}

   and we see that /L/′ is precisely the same function as /L/.

   The momenta are

   \begin{equation}
   {\partial_{2}L(t;x,y,z;v_{x},v_{y},v_{z}) = \lbrack mv_{x},mv_{y},mv_{z}\rbrack} & {(1.167)}
   \end{equation}

   and

   \begin{equation}
   {D\widetilde{F}(0)(t;x,y,z) = D{\widetilde{R}}_{z}(0)(x,y,z) = (y, - x,0).} & {(1.168)}
   \end{equation}

   So the Noether integral is

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {\mathcal{I}(t;x,y,z;v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})} & {=
   ((\partial_{2}L)(D\widetilde{F}(0)))(t;x,y,z;v_{x},v_{y},v_{z})} & \\
   & {= m(yv_{x} - xv_{y}),} & {(1.169)} \end{equation}



   which we recognize as minus the /z/ component of the angular momentum:

   $\overset{\rightarrow}{x} \times (m\overset{\rightarrow}{v})$

   . Since the Lagrangian is preserved by any continuous rotational symmetry,
   all components of the vector angular momenta are conserved for the
   central-potential problem.

   The procedure calls ((Rx angle-x) q), ((Ry angle-y) q), and ((Rz angle-z) q)
   rotate the rectangular tuple q about the indicated axis by the indicated
   angle.[fn:88] We use these to make a parametric coordinate transformation
   F-tilde:

    #+begin_src scheme
(define (F-tilde angle-x angle-y angle-z) (compose (Rx angle-x) (Ry angle-y) (Rz
angle-z) coordinate))
    #+end_src

   A Lagrangian for motion in a central potential is

    #+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-central-rectangular m U) state) (let ((q
   (coordinate state)) (v (velocity state))) (- (* 1/2 m (square v)) (U (sqrt
   (square q))))))
    #+end_src

   The Noether integral is then

    #+begin_src scheme
(define the-Noether-integral (let ((L
   (L-central-rectangular 'm (literal-function 'U)))) (* ((partial 2) L) ((D

'vz))) (down (+ (* m vy z) (* -1 m vz y)) (+ (* m vz x) (* -1 m vx z)) (+ (* m
vx y) (* -1 m vy x)))
    #+end_src

   We get all three components of the angular momentum.



   *Exercise 1.36: Noether integral*

   Consider motion on an ellipsoidal surface. The surface is specified by:

   $x^{2}/a^{2} + y^{2}/b^{2} + z^{2}/c^{2} = 1$

   Formulate a Lagrangian for frictionless motion on this surface. Assume that
   two of the axes of the ellipsoid are equal: /b/ = /c/.

   Using angular coordinates (/θ/, /ϕ/), where /θ/ is colatitude from the
   /ẑ/-axis, and /ϕ/ is longitude measured from the

   $\widehat{x}$

   -axis, formulate a Lagrangian that captures the symmetry of this ellipsoid:
   rotational symmetry around the

   $\widehat{x}$

   -axis. Formulate a parametric transformation that represents this symmetry
   and show that the Lagrangian you formulated is invariant under this
   transformation. Compute the Noether integral associated with this symmetry.

   Note that the choice of coordinates does not build in this symmetry.

* 1.9 Abstraction of Path Functions
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6d
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  An essential step in the derivation of the local-tuple transformation function
  /C/ from the coordinate transformation /F/ was the deduction of the
  relationship between the velocities in the two coordinate systems. We did this
  by inserting coordinate paths into the coordinate transformation function /F/,
  differentiating, and then generalizing the results on the path to arbitrary
  velocities at a moment. The last step is an example of a more general problem
  of abstracting a local-tuple function from a path function. Given a function
  /f/ of a local tuple, a corresponding path-dependent function

  $\overline{f}\lbrack q\rbrack\,\text{is}\,\overline{f}\lbrack q\rbrack = f
  \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$

  . Given

  $\overline{f}$

  , how can we reconstitute /f/? The local-tuple function /f/ depends on only a
  finite number of components of the local tuple, and

  $\overline{f}$

  depends only on the corresponding local components of the path. So

  $\overline{f}$

  has the same value for all paths that have that number of components of the
  local tuple in common. Given

  $\overline{f}$

  we can reconstitute /f/ by taking the argument of /f/, which is a finite
  initial segment of a local tuple, constructing a path that has this local
  description, and finding the value of

  $\overline{f}$

  for this path.

  Two paths that have the same local description up to the /n/th derivative are
  said to /osculate with order n contact/. For example, a path and the truncated
  power series representation of the path up to order /n/ have order /n/
  contact; if fewer than /n/ derivatives are needed by a local-tuple function,
  the path and the truncated power series representation are equivalent. Let /O/
  be a function that generates an osculating path with the given local-tuple
  components. So /O/(/t/, /q/, /v/, ...)(/t/) = /q/, /D/(/O/(/t/, /q/, /v/,
  ...))(/t/) = /v/, and in general

  \begin{equation}
  {(t,q,v,\ldots) = \Gamma\lbrack O(t,q,v,\ldots)\rbrack(t).} & {(1.170)}
  \end{equation}

  The number of components of the local tuple that are required is finite, but
  unspecified. One way of constructing /O/ is through the truncated power series

  \begin{equation}
  {O(t,q,v,a,\ldots)(t\prime) = q + v(t\prime - t) + \frac{1}{2}a{(t\prime - t)}^{2} + \cdots,} & {(1.171)}
  \end{equation}

  where the number of terms is the same as the number of components of the local
  tuple that are specified.

  Given the path function

  $\overline{f}$

  we reconstitute the /f/ function as follows. We take the argument of /f/ and
  construct an osculating path with this local description. Then the value of
  /f/ is the value of

  $\overline{f}$

  for this osculating path:

  $$\begin{array}{lll} {f(t,q,v,\ldots)} & {= (f \circ \Gamma\lbrack
  O(t,q,v,\ldots)\rbrack)(t)} & \\
  & {= \overline{f}\lbrack O(t,q,v,\ldots)\rbrack(t).} & {(1.172)}
  \end{equation}

  Let

  $\overline{\Gamma}$

  be the function that takes a path function and returns the corresponding
  local-tuple function:[fn:89]

  \begin{equation}
  {f = \overline{\Gamma}(\overline{f}).} & {(1.173)}
  \end{equation}

  From equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.172][1.172]]) we see that

  \begin{equation}
  {\overline{\Gamma}(\overline{f})(t,q,v,\ldots) = \overline{f}\lbrack O(t,q,v,\ldots)\rbrack(t).} & {(1.174)}
  \end{equation}

  The procedure Gamma-bar implements the function

  $\overline{\Gamma}$

  that reconstitutes a path-dependent function into a local-tuple function:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define ((Gamma-bar f-bar) local) ((f-bar
  (osculating-path local)) (time local)))
   #+end_src



  The procedure osculating-path takes a number of local components and returns a
  path with these components; it is implemented as a power series.

  We can use Gamma-bar to construct the procedure F->C that takes a coordinate
  transformation F and generates the procedure that transforms local tuples. The
  procedure F->C constructs a path-dependent procedure f-bar that takes a
  coordinate path in the primed system and returns the local tuple of the
  corresponding path in the unprimed coordinate system. It then uses Gamma-bar
  to abstract f-bar to arbitrary local tuples in the primed coordinate
  system.[fn:90]

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (F->C F) (define (C local) (let ((n
  (vector-length local))) (define (f-bar q-prime) (define q (compose F (Gamma

  Notice that in this definition of F->C we do not explicitly calculate any
  derivatives. The calculation that led up to the state transformation
  ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.77][1.77]]) is not needed.

  We can also use

  $\overline{\Gamma}$

  to make an elegant formula for computing the total time derivative /D_{t}F/ of
  the function /F/ :

  $$\begin{array}{llll} {D_{t}F = \overline{\Gamma}(\overline{G}),} &
  \text{with} & {\overline{G}\lbrack q\rbrack = D(F \circ \Gamma\lbrack
  q\rbrack).} & {(1.175)} \end{equation}

  The total time derivative can be expressed as a program:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (Dt F) (define (DtF state) (let ((n
  (vector-length state))) (define (DF-on-path q) (D (compose F (Gamma q (- n
1))))) ((Gamma-bar DF-on-path) state))) DtF)
   #+end_src

  Given a procedure F implementing a local-tuple function and a path q, we
  construct a new procedure (compose F (Gamma q)). The procedure DF-on-path
  implements the derivative of this function of time. We then abstract this off
  the path with Gamma-bar to give the total time derivative.

  *Exercise 1.37: Velocity transformation*

  Use the procedure Gamma-bar to construct a procedure that transforms
  velocities given a coordinate transformation. Apply this procedure to the
  procedure p->r to deduce (again) equation

** Lagrange equations at a moment

   Given a Lagrangian, the Lagrange equations test paths to determine whether
   they are realizable paths of the system. The Lagrange equations relate the
   path and its derivatives. The fact that the Lagrange equations must be
   satisfied at each moment suggests that we can abstract the Lagrange equations
   off the path and write them as relations among the local-tuple components of
   realizable paths.

   Let

   $\overline{\mathcal{E}}$

   [/L/] be the path-dependent function that produces the residuals of the
   Lagrange equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.12][1.12]]) for the
   Lagrangian /L/:

   \begin{equation}
   {\overline{\mathcal{E}}\lbrack L\rbrack\lbrack q\rbrack = D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - \partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack.} & {(1.176)}
   \end{equation}



   Realizable paths /q/ satisfy the Lagrange equations

   \begin{equation}
   {\overline{\mathcal{E}}\lbrack L\rbrack\lbrack q\rbrack = 0.} & {(1.177)}
   \end{equation}

   The path-dependent Lagrange equations can be converted to local Lagrange
   equations using

   $\overline{\Gamma}$

   :

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack = \overline{\Gamma}(\overline{\mathcal{E}}\lbrack L\rbrack).} & {(1.178)}
   \end{equation}

   The operator

   $\mathcal{E}$

   is called the /Euler--Lagrange operator/. In terms of this operator the
   Lagrange equations are

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = 0.} & {(1.179)}
   \end{equation}

   The Euler--Lagrange operator is explicitly

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack = D_{t}\partial_{2}L - \partial_{1}L.} & {(1.180)}

* 1.10 Constrained Motion
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6e
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  An advantage of the Lagrangian approach is that coordinates can often be
  chosen that exactly describe the freedom of the system, automatically
  incorporating any constraints. We may also use coordinates that have more
  freedom than the system actually has and consider explicit constraints among
  the coordinates. For example, the planar pendulum has a one-dimensional
  configuration space. We have formulated this problem using the angle from the
  vertical as the configuration coordinate. Alternatively, we may choose to
  represent the pendulum as a body moving in the plane, constrained to be on the
  circle of the correct radius around the pivot. We would like to have valid
  descriptions for both choices and show they are equivalent. In this section we
  develop tools to handle problems with explicit constraints. The constraints
  considered here are more general than those used in the demonstration that the
  Lagrangian for systems with rigid constraints can be written as the difference
  of kinetic and potential energies (see [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]).

  Suppose the configuration of a system with /n/ degrees of freedom is specified
  by /n/ + 1 coordinates and that configuration paths /q/ are constrained to
  satisfy some relation of the form

  \begin{equation}
  {\varphi(t,q(t),Dq(t)) = 0.} & {(1.181)}
  \end{equation}

  How do we formulate the equations of motion? One approach would be to use the
  constraint equation to eliminate one of the coordinates in favor of the rest;
  then the evolution of the reduced set of generalized coordinates would be
  described by the usual Lagrange equations. The equations governing the
  evolution of coordinates that are not fully independent should be equivalent.

  We can address the problem of formulating equations of motion for systems with
  redundant coordinates by returning to the action principle. Realizable paths
  are distinguished from other paths by having stationary action. Stationary
  refers to the fact that the action does not change with certain small
  variations of the path. What variations should be considered? We have seen
  that velocity-independent rigid constraints can be used to eliminate redundant
  coordinates. In the irredundant coordinates we distinguished realizable paths
  by using variations that by construction satisfy the constraints. Thus in the
  case where constraints can be used to eliminate redundant coordinates we can
  restrict the variations in the path to those that are consistent with the
  constraints.

  So how does the restriction of the possible variations affect the argument
  that led to Lagrange's equations (refer to [[file:chapter001.html#h1-6][section 1.5]])? Actually most of the
  calculation is unaffected. The condition that the action is stationary still
  reduces to the conditions ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.17][1.17]]) or ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.34][1.34]]):

  \begin{equation}
  {0 = {\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\left\{ {(\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)} \right\}\eta.}}} & {(1.182)}
  \end{equation}

  At this point we argued that because the variations $\eta$ are arbitrary
  (except for conditions at the endpoints), the only way for the integral to be
  zero is for the integrand to be zero. Furthermore, the freedom in our choice
  of $\eta$ allowed us to deduce that the factor multiplying $\eta$ in the
  integrand must be identically zero, thereby deriving Lagrange's equations.

  Now the choice of $\eta$ is not completely free. We can still deduce from the
  arbitrariness of $\eta$ that the integrand must be zero,[fn:91] but we can no
  longer deduce that the factor multiplying $\eta$ is zero (only that the
  projection of this factor onto acceptable variations is zero). So we have

  \begin{equation}
  {\left\{ {(\partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)} \right\}\eta = 0,} & {(1.183)}
  \end{equation}

  with $\eta$ subject to the constraints.

  A path /q/ satisfies the constraint if

  $\overline{\varphi}\lbrack q\rbrack = \varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack =
  0$

  . The constraint must be satisfied even for the varied path, so we allow only
  variations $\eta$ for which the variation of the constraint is zero:

  \begin{equation}
  {\delta_{\eta}(\overline{\varphi}) = 0.} & {(1.184)}
  \end{equation}



  We can say that the variation must be “tangent” to the constraint surface.
  Expanding this with the chain rule, a variation $\eta$ is tangent to the
  constraint surface /φ/ if

  \begin{equation}
  {(\partial_{1}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\,\eta + (\partial_{2}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\, D\eta = 0.} & {(1.185)}
  \end{equation}

  Note that these are functions of time; the variation at a given time is
  tangent to the constraint at that time.

*** 1.10.1 Coordinate Constraints

    :CLASS:    level3

    Consider constraints that do not depend on velocities:

    $\partial_{2}\varphi = 0.$

    In this case the variation is tangent to the constraint surface if

    \begin{equation}
    {(\partial_{1}\varphi \circ \Gamma)\,\,\,\eta = 0.} & {(1.186)}
    \end{equation}

    Together, equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.183][1.183]]) and ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.186][1.186]]) should determine the motion, but how
    do we eliminate $\eta$? The residual of the Lagrange equations is
    orthogonal[fn:92] to any $\eta$ that is orthogonal to the normal to the
    constraint surface. A vector that is orthogonal to all vectors orthogonal to
    a given vector is parallel to the given vector. Thus, the residual of
    Lagrange's equations is parallel to the normal to the constraint surface;
    the two must be proportional:

    \begin{equation}
    {D(\partial_{2}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - \partial_{1}L \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \lambda(\partial_{1}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.187)}
    \end{equation}

    That the two vectors are parallel everywhere along the path does not
    guarantee that the proportionality factor is the same at each moment along
    the path, so the proportionality factor /λ/ is some function of time, which
    may depend on the path under consideration. These equations, with the
    constraint equation /φ/ ∘ Γ[/q/] = 0, are the governing equations. These
    equations are sufficient to determine the path /q/ and to eliminate the
    unknown function /λ/.



** Now watch this

   :CUSTOM_ID: now-watch-this

   Suppose we form an augmented Lagrangian by treating /λ/ as one of the
   coordinates:

   {L\prime(t;q,\lambda;\overset{˙}{q},\overset{˙}{\lambda}) = L(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) + \lambda\varphi(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}).} & {(1.188)}
   \end{equation}

   The Lagrange equations associated with the coordinates /q/ are just the
   modified Lagrange equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.187][1.187]]), and the Lagrange equation associated
   with /λ/ is just the constraint equation. (Note that

   $\overset{˙}{\lambda}$

   does not appear in the augmented Lagrangian.) So the Lagrange equations for
   this augmented Lagrangian fully encapsulate the modification to the Lagrange
   equations that is imposed by the addition of an explicit coordinate
   constraint, at the expense of introducing extra degrees of freedom. Notice
   that this Lagrangian is of the same form as the Lagrangian (equation [[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.93][1.93]])
   that we used in the derivation of /L/ = /T/ − /V/ for rigid systems
   ([[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-6-2][section 1.6.2]]).

** Alternatively

   How do we know that we have enough information to eliminate the unknown
   function /λ/ from equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.187][1.187]]), or
   that the extra degree of freedom introduced in Lagrangian
   ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.188][1.188]]) is purely formal?

   If /λ/ can be written as a composition of a state-dependent function with the
   path: /λ/ = Λ ∘ Γ[/q/] then it is redundant as a degree of freedom. Consider
   the Lagrangian

   \begin{equation}
   {L'' = L + \Lambda\varphi.} & {(1.189)}
   \end{equation}

   This new Lagrangian has no extra degrees of freedom. The Lagrange equations
   for /L/″ are the Lagrange equations for /L/ with additional terms arising
   from the product Λ/φ/. Applying the Euler--Lagrange operator

   $\mathcal{E}$

   (see [[file:chapter001.html#h1-6d][section 1.9]]) to this Lagrangian
   gives[fn:93]

   $$\begin{array}{lll} {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L''\rbrack} & {= \mathcal{E}\lbrack
   L\rbrack + \mathcal{E}\lbrack\Lambda\varphi\rbrack} & \\

   \mathcal{E}\lbrack\Lambda\rbrack\varphi + D_{t}\Lambda\partial_{2}\varphi +
   \partial_{2}\Lambda D_{t}\varphi.} & {(1.190)} \end{equation}

   Composition of

   $\mathcal{E}$

   [/L/″] with Γ[/q/] gives the Lagrange equations for the path /q/. Using the
   fact that the constraint is satisfied on the path /φ/ ∘ Γ[/q/] = 0 and
   consequently /D_{t}φ/ ∘ Γ[/q/] = 0, we have



   \begin{equation} {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L''\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack}
   & \\ {\text{       } = \mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack + \lambda(\mathcal{E}\lbrack\varphi\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack
   q\rbrack) + D\lambda(\partial_{2}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack),} &
   {(1.191)} \end{equation}

   where we have used /λ/ = Λ ∘ Γ[/q/]. If we now use the fact that we are
   dealing only with coordinate constraints, ∂_{2}/φ/ = 0, then

   \begin{equation}
   {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L''\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack + \lambda(\mathcal{E}\lbrack\varphi\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.192)}
   \end{equation}

   The Lagrange equations are the same as those derived from the augmented
   Lagrangian /L/′. The difference is that now we see that /λ/ = Λ ∘ Γ[/q/] is
   determined by the unaugmented state. This is the same as saying that /λ/ can
   be eliminated.

   Considering only the formal validity of the Lagrange equations for the
   augmented Lagrangian, we could not deduce that /λ/ could be written as the
   composition of a state-dependent function Λ with Γ[/q/]. The explicit
   Lagrange equations derived from the augmented Lagrangian depend on the
   accelerations /D/^{2}/q/ as well as /λ/, so we cannot deduce separately that
   either is the composition of a state-dependent function and Γ[/q/]. However,
   now we see that /λ/ is such a composition. This allows us to deduce that
   /D/^{2}/q/ is also a state-dependent function composed with the path. The
   evolution of the system is determined from the dynamical state.

** The pendulum using constraints
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-pendulum-using-constraints

   :END:
   The pendulum can be formulated as the motion of a massive particle in a
   vertical plane subject to the constraint that the distance to the pivot is
   constant (see [[file:chapter001.html#Fig_1-8][figure 1.8]]).

   In this formulation, the kinetic and potential energies in the Lagrangian are
   those of an unconstrained particle in a uniform gravitational acceleration. A
   Lagrangian for the unconstrained particle is

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;x,y;v_{x},v_{y}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2} \right) - mgy.} & {(1.193)}
   \end{equation}

   The constraint that the pendulum moves in a circle of radius /l/ about the
   pivot is[fn:94]

   \begin{equation}
   {x^{2} + y^{2} - l^{2} = 0.} & {(1.194)}
   \end{equation}



   The augmented Lagrangian is

   \begin{equation}
   {L\prime(t;x,y,\lambda;v_{x},v_{y},\overset{˙}{\lambda}) = \frac{1}{2}m\left( v_{x}^{2} + v_{y}^{2} \right) - mgy + \lambda\left( x^{2} + y^{2} - l^{2} \right).} & {(1.195)}
   \end{equation}

   The Lagrange equations for the augmented Lagrangian are

   \begin{equation}
   {mD^{2}x - 2\lambda x = 0} & {(1.196)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {mD^{2}y + mg - 2\lambda y = 0} & {(1.197)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {x^{2} + y^{2} - l^{2} = 0.} & {(1.198)}
   \end{equation}

   These equations are sufficient to solve for the motion of the pendulum.

   It should not be surprising that these equations simplify if we switch to
   “polar” coordinates

   \begin{equation}
   {x = r\sin\theta\text{       }y = - r\cos\theta.} & {(1.199)}
   \end{equation}

   Substituting this into the constraint equation, we determine that /r/ = /l/,
   a constant. Forming the derivatives and substituting into the other two
   equations, we find

   \begin{equation}
   {ml(\cos\theta\, D^{2}\theta - \sin\theta\,{(D\theta)}^{2}) - 2\lambda\sin\theta = 0} & {(1.200)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {ml(\sin\theta\, D^{2}\theta + \cos\theta\,{(D\theta)}^{2}) + mg + 2\lambda\cos\theta = 0.} & {(1.201)}
   \end{equation}

   Multiplying the first by cos /θ/ and the second by sin /θ/ and adding, we
   find

   \begin{equation}
   {mlD^{2}\theta + mg\sin\theta = 0,} & {(1.202)}
   \end{equation}

   which we recognize as the correct equation for the pendulum. This is the same
   as the Lagrange equation for the pendulum using the unconstrained generalized
   coordinate /θ/. For completeness, we can find /λ/ in terms of the other
   variables:

   \begin{equation}
   {\lambda = \frac{mD^{2}x}{2x} = - \frac{1}{2l}(mg\cos\theta + ml{(D\theta)}^{2}).} & {(1.203)}
   \end{equation}

   This confirms that /λ/ is really the composition of a function of the state
   with the state path. Notice that 2/lλ/ is a force---it is the sum of the
   outward component of the gravitational force and the centrifugal force. Using
   this interpretation in the two coordinate equations of motion, we see that
   the terms involving /λ/ are the forces that must be applied to the
   unconstrained particle to make it move on the circle required by the
   constraints. Equivalently, we may think of 2/lλ/ as the tension in the
   pendulum rod that holds the mass.[fn:95]

** Building systems from parts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: building-systems-from-parts
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   The method of using augmented Lagrangians to enforce constraints on dynamical
   systems provides a way to analyze a compound system by combining the results
   of the analysis of the parts of the system and the coupling between them.

   Consider the compound spring-mass system shown at the top of [[file:chapter001.html#Fig_1-9][figure 1.9]]. We
   could analyze this as a monolithic system with two configuration coordinates
   /x/_{1} and /x/_{2}, representing the extensions of the springs from their
   equilibrium lengths /X/_{1} and /X/_{2}.

   An alternative procedure is to break the system into several parts. In our
   spring-mass system we can choose two parts: one is a spring and mass attached
   to the wall, and the other is a spring and mass with its attachment point at
   an additional configuration coordinate $\xi$. We can formulate a Lagrangian
   for each part separately. We can then choose a Lagrangian for the composite
   system as the sum of the two component Lagrangians with a constraint $\xi$ =
   /X/_{1} + /x/_{1} to accomplish the coupling.



   Let's see how this works. The Lagrangian for the subsystem attached to the
   wall is

   \begin{equation}
   {L_{1}(t,x_{1},{\overset{˙}{x}}_{1}) = \frac{1}{2}m_{1}{\overset{˙}{x}}_{1}^{2} - \frac{1}{2}k_{1}x_{1}^{2}} & {(1.204)}
   \end{equation}

   and the Lagrangian for the subsystem that attaches to it is

   \begin{equation}
   {L_{2}(t;\xi,x_{2};\overset{˙}{\xi},{\overset{˙}{x}}_{2}) = \frac{1}{2}m_{2}{(\overset{˙}{\xi} + {\overset{˙}{x}}_{2})}^{2} - \frac{1}{2}k_{2}x_{2}^{2}.} & {(1.205)}
   \end{equation}

   We construct a Lagrangian for the system composed from these parts as a sum
   of the Lagrangians for each of the separate parts, with a coupling term to
   enforce the constraint:

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;x_{1},x_{2},\xi,\lambda;{\overset{˙}{x}}_{1},{\overset{˙}{x}}_{2},\overset{˙}{\xi},\overset{˙}{\lambda})} & \\
   {\text{         } = L_{1}(t,x_{1},{\overset{˙}{x}}_{1}) + L_{2}(t;\xi,x_{2};\overset{˙}{\xi},{\overset{˙}{x}}_{2})} & \\
   {\text{         }\text{         } + \lambda(\xi - (X_{1} + x_{1})).} & {(1.206)}
   \end{equation}

   Thus we can write Lagrange's equations for the four configuration
   coordinates, in order, as follows:

   $$\begin{aligned} {m_{1}D^{2}x_{1} = - k_{1}x_{1} - \lambda} & {(1.207)}
   \\ \end{aligned}$$

   $$\begin{aligned} {m_{2}(D^{2}\xi + D^{2}x_{2}) = - k_{2}x_{2}} & {(1.208)}
   \\ \end{aligned}$$

   $$\begin{aligned} {m_{2}(D^{2}\xi + D^{2}x_{2}) = \lambda} & {(1.209)}
   \\ \end{aligned}$$

   $$\begin{aligned} {0 = \xi - (X_{1} + x_{1}).} & {(1.210)} \end{aligned}$$

   Notice that in this system /λ/ is the force of constraint holding the system
   together. We can now eliminate the “glue” coordinates $\xi$ and /λ/ to obtain
   the equations of motion in the coordinates /x/_{1} and /x/_{2}:

   \begin{equation}
   {m_{1}D^{2}x_{1} + m_{2}(D^{2}x_{1} + D^{2}x_{2}) + k_{1}x_{1} = 0} & {(1.211)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {m_{2}(D^{2}x_{1} + D^{2}x_{2}) + k_{2}x_{2} = 0.} & {(1.212)}
   \end{equation}

   This strategy can be generalized. We can make a library of primitive
   components. Each component may be characterized by a Lagrangian with
   additional degrees of freedom for the /terminals/ where that component may be
   attached to others. We then can construct composite Lagrangians by combining
   components, using constraints to glue together the terminals.



   #+caption: *Figure 1.9* A compound spring-mass system is decomposed into
   two subsystems. We have two springs coupling two masses that can move
   horizontally. The equilibrium positions of the springs are /X/_{1} and
   /X/_{2}. The systems are coupled by the coordinate constraint /ξ/ = /X/_{1} +

   *a.* Make another primitive component, compatible with the spring-mass
   structures described in this section. For example, make a pendulum that can
   attach to the spring-mass system. Build a combination and derive the
   equations of motion. Be careful, the algebra is horrible if you choose bad
   coordinates.

   *b.* For a nice little project, construct a family of compatible mechanical
   parts, characterized by appropriate Lagrangians, that can be combined in a
   variety of ways to make interesting mechanisms. Remember that in a good
   language the result of combining pieces should be a piece of the same kind
   that can be further combined with other pieces.

   Consider again the motion of a bead constrained to move on a triaxial surface
   ([[file:chapter001.html#Exe_1-18][exercise 1.18]]). Reformulate this using rectangular coordinates as the
   generalized coordinates with an explicit constraint that the bead must stay
   on the surface. Find a Lagrangian and show that the Lagrange equations are

   *a.* Find an augmented Lagrangian for this system, and derive the equations
   governing the motion of the point mass in /x/ and /y/.

    :END:
    Here we investigate velocity-dependent constraints that are “total time
    derivatives” of velocity-independent constraints. The methods presented so
    far do not apply because the constraint is velocity-dependent.

    Consider a velocity-dependent constraint /ψ/ = 0. That /ψ/ is a total time
    derivative means that there exists a velocity-independent function /φ/ such
    that

    \begin{equation}
    {\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = D(\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.213)}
    \end{equation}

    That /φ/ is velocity-independent means ∂_{2}/φ/ = 0. As state functions the
    relationship between /ψ/ and /φ/ is

    \begin{equation}
    {\psi = D_{t}\varphi = \partial_{0}\varphi + \partial_{1}\varphi\overset{˙}{Q}.} & {(1.214)}
    \end{equation}

    Given a /ψ/ we can find /φ/ by solving this linear partial differential
    equation. The solution is determined up to a constant, so /ψ/ = 0 implies
    /φ/ = /K/ for some constant /K/. On the other hand, if we knew /φ/ = /K/
    then /ψ/ = 0 follows. Thus the velocity-dependent constraint /ψ/ = 0 is
    equivalent to the velocity-independent constraint /φ/ = /K/, and we know how
    to find Lagrange equations for such systems.



    If /L/ is a Lagrangian for the unconstrained problem, the Lagrange equations
    with the constraint /φ/ = /K/ are

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack + \lambda\,(\mathcal{E}\lbrack\varphi\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = 0,} & {(1.215)}
    \end{equation}

    where /λ/ is a function of time that will be eliminated during the solution
    process. The constant /K/ does not affect the Lagrange equations. The
    function /φ/ is independent of velocity, ∂_{2}/φ/ = 0, so the Lagrange
    equations become

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack - \lambda(\partial_{1}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = 0.} & {(1.216)}
    \end{equation}

    From equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.214][1.214]]) we see that

    \begin{equation}
    {\partial_{1}\varphi = \partial_{2}\psi,} & {(1.217)}
    \end{equation}

    so the Lagrange equations with the constraint /ψ/ = 0 are

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \lambda(\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.218)}
    \end{equation}

    The important feature is that we can write the Lagrange equations directly
    in terms of /ψ/ without having to produce /φ/. But the validity of these
    Lagrange equations depends on the existence of /φ/.

    It turns out that the augmented Lagrangian trick also works here. These
    Lagrange equations are given if we augment the Lagrangian with the
    constraint /ψ/ multiplied by a function of time /λ/′:

    \begin{equation}
    {L\prime = L + \lambda\prime\psi.} & {(1.219)}
    \end{equation}

    The Lagrange equations for /L/′ turn out to be

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = - D\lambda\prime(\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack),} & {(1.220)}
    \end{equation}

    which, with the identification /λ/ = −/Dλ/′, are the same as Lagrange
    equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.218][1.218]]).

    Sometimes a problem can be naturally formulated in terms of
    velocity-dependent constraints. The formalism we have developed will handle
    any velocity-dependent constraint that can be written in terms of the
    derivative of a coordinate constraint. Such a constraint is called an
    /integrable constraint/. Any system for which the constraints can be put in
    the form of a coordinate constraint, or are already in that form, is called
    a /holonomic system/.

    *Exercise 1.42: Augmented Lagrangian*

    Show that the augmented Lagrangian
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.219][1.219]]) does lead to the Lagrange
    equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.220][1.220]]), taking into account
    the fact that /ψ/ is a total time derivative of /φ/.

** Goldstein's hoop
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: goldsteins-hoop
   :CLASS:    level2
   :END:
   Here we consider a problem for which the constraint can be represented as a
   time derivative of a coordinate constraint: a hoop of mass /M/ and radius /R/
   rolling, without slipping, down a (one-dimensional) inclined plane (see
   [[file:chapter001.html#Fig_1-10][figure 1.10]]).[fn:96]

   We will formulate this problem in terms of the two coordinates /θ/, the
   rotation of an arbitrary point on the hoop from an arbitrary reference
   direction, and /x/, the linear progress down the inclined plane. The
   constraint is that the hoop does not slip. Thus a change in /θ/ is exactly
   reflected in a change in /x/; the constraint function is

   \begin{equation}
   {\psi(t;x,\theta;\overset{˙}{x},\overset{˙}{\theta}) = R\overset{˙}{\theta} - \overset{˙}{x}.} & {(1.221)}
   \end{equation}

   This constraint is phrased as a relation among generalized velocities, but it
   could be integrated to get /x/ = /Rθ/ + /c/. We may form our augmented
   Lagrangian with either the integrated constraint or its derivative.



   The kinetic energy has two parts, the energy of rotation of the hoop and the
   energy of the motion of its center of mass.[fn:97] The potential energy of
   the hoop decreases as the height decreases. Thus we may write the augmented
   Lagrangian:

   \begin{equation}
   {L(t;x,\theta,\lambda;\overset{˙}{x},\overset{˙}{\theta},\lambda)} & \\
   {\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, = \frac{1}{2}M\, R^{2}{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}M\,{\overset{˙}{x}}^{2} + M\, gx\sin\varphi + \lambda(R\overset{˙}{\theta} - \overset{˙}{x}).} & {(1.222)}
   \end{equation}

   Lagrange's equations are

   \begin{equation}
   {M\, D^{2}x - D\lambda = M\, g\sin\varphi} & {(1.223)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {M\, R^{2}D^{2}\theta + R\, D\lambda = 0} & {(1.224)}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   {R\, D\theta - Dx = 0.} & {(1.225)}
   \end{equation}

   And by differentiation of the third Lagrange equation we obtain

   \begin{equation}
   {D^{2}x = RD^{2}\theta.} & {(1.226)}
   \end{equation}

   By combining these equations we can solve for the dynamical quantities of
   interest. For this case of a rolling hoop the linear acceleration

   \begin{equation}
   {D^{2}x = \frac{1}{2}g\sin\varphi} & {(1.227)}
   \end{equation}

   is just half of what it would have been if the mass had just slid down a
   frictionless plane without rotating. Note that for this hoop /D/^{2}/x/ is
   independent of both /M/ and /R/. We see from the Lagrange equations that /Dλ/
   can be interpreted as the friction force involved in enforcing the
   constraint. The frictional force of constraint is

   \begin{equation}
   {D\lambda = \frac{1}{2}M\, g\sin\varphi} & {(1.228)}
   \end{equation}

   and the angular acceleration is

   \begin{equation}
   {D^{2}\theta = \frac{1}{2}\frac{g}{R}\sin\varphi.} & {(1.229)}
   \end{equation}



*** 1.10.3 Nonholonomic Systems
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: h3_1-10-3
    :CLASS:    level3
    :END:
    Systems with constraints that are not integrable are termed /non-holonomic
    systems/. A constraint is not integrable if it cannot be written in terms of
    an equivalent coordinate constraint. An example of a nonholonomic system is
    a ball rolling without slipping in a bowl. As the ball rolls it must turn so
    that its surface does not move relative to the bowl at the point of contact.
    This looks as if it might establish a relation between the location of the
    ball in the bowl and the orientation of the ball, but it doesn't. The ball
    may return to the same place in the bowl with different orientations
    depending on the intervening path it has taken. As a consequence, the
    constraints cannot be used to eliminate any coordinates.

    What are the equations of motion governing nonholonomic systems? For the
    restricted set of systems with nonholonomic constraints that are linear in
    the velocities, it is widely reported[fn:98] that the equations of motion
    are as follows. Let /ψ/ have the form

    \begin{equation}
    {\psi(t,q,v) = G_{1}(t,q)v + G_{2}(t,q),} & {(1.230)}
    \end{equation}

    a state function that is linear in the velocities. We assume /ψ/ is not a
    total time derivative. If /L/ is a Lagrangian for the unconstrained system,
    then the equations of motion are asserted to be

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \lambda(G_{1} \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) = \lambda(\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.231)}
    \end{equation}

    With the constraint /ψ/ = 0, the system is completely specified and the
    evolution of the system is determined. Note that these equations are
    identical to the Lagrange equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.218][1.218]]) for the case that /ψ/ is a total
    time derivative, but here the derivation of those equations is no longer
    valid.

    An essential step in the derivation of the Lagrange equations for coordinate
    constraints /φ/ = 0 with ∂_{2}/φ/ = 0 was to note that two conditions must
    be satisfied:

    $$(\begin{equation} {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack
    q\rbrack)\eta = 0,} & {(1.232)} \end{equation}

    and

    $$(\begin{equation} {\partial_{1}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\eta =
    0.} & {(1.233)} \end{equation}



    Because

    $\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$

    is orthogonal to $\eta$ and $\eta$ is constrained to be orthogonal to
    ∂_{1}/φ/ ∘ Γ[/q/], the two must be parallel at each moment:

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \lambda(\partial_{1}\varphi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.234)}
    \end{equation}

    The Lagrange equations for derivative constraints were derived from this.

    This derivation does not go through if the constraint function depends on
    velocity. In this case, for a variation $\eta$ to be consistent with the
    velocity-dependent constraint function /ψ/ it must satisfy (see equation
    [[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.185][1.185]])

    \begin{equation}
    {(\partial_{1}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\eta + (\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)D\eta = 0.} & {(1.235)}
    \end{equation}

    We may no longer eliminate $\eta$ by the same argument, because $\eta$ is no
    longer orthogonal to ∂_{1}/ψ/ ∘ Γ[/q/], and we cannot rewrite the constraint
    as a coordinate constraint because /ψ/ is, by assumption, not integrable.

    The following is the derivation of the nonholonomic equations from Arnold et
    al. [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_6][6]]], translated into our notation. Define a “virtual velocity” $\xi$ to
    be any velocity satisfying

    $$(\begin{equation} {\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\xi = 0.}
    & {(1.236)} \end{equation}

    The “principle of d'Alembert--Lagrange,” according to Arnold, states that

    \begin{equation}
    {(\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack)\xi = 0,} & {(1.237)}
    \end{equation}

    for any virtual velocity $\xi$. Because $\xi$ is arbitrary except that it is
    required to be orthogonal to ∂_{2}/ψ/ ∘ Γ[/q/] and any such $\xi$ is
    orthogonal to

    $\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$

    , then ∂_{2}/ψ/ ∘ Γ[/q/] must be parallel to

    $\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$

    . So

    \begin{equation}
    {\mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = \lambda(\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack),} & {(1.238)}
    \end{equation}

    which are the nonholonomic equations.

    To convert the stationary action equations to the equations of Arnold we
    must do the following. To get from equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.232][1.232]]) to equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.237][1.237]]), we
    must replace $\eta$ by $\xi$. However, to get from equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.235][1.235]]) to
    equation ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.236][1.236]]), we must set $\eta = 0$ and replace /Dη/ by $\xi$. All
    “derivations” of the nonholonomic equations have similar identifications. It
    comes down to this: the nonholonomic equations do not follow from the action
    principle. They are something else. Whether they are correct or not depends
    on whether or not they agree with experiment.

    For systems with either coordinate constraints or derivative constraints, we
    have found that the Lagrange equations can be derived from a Lagrangian that
    is augmented with the constraint. However, if the constraints are not
    integrable the Lagrange equations for the augmented Lagrangian are not the
    same as the non-holonomic system (equations [[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.231][1.231]]).[fn:99] Let /L/′ be an
    augmented Lagrangian with non-integrable constraint /ψ/:

    \begin{equation}
    {L\prime(t;q,\lambda;\overset{˙}{q},\overset{˙}{\lambda}) = L(t,q,\overset{˙}{q}) + \lambda\psi(t,q,\overset{˙}{q});} & {(1.239)}
    \end{equation}

    then the Lagrange equations associated with the coordinates are

    \begin{equation}
    {0 = \mathcal{E}\lbrack L\rbrack \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack} & \\
    {\,\,\,\,\, + D\lambda(\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) + \lambda D(\partial_{2}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack) - \lambda(\partial_{1}\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack).} & {(1.240)}
    \end{equation}

    The Lagrange equation associated with /λ/ is just the constraint equation

    \begin{equation}
    {\psi \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack = 0.} & {(1.241)}
    \end{equation}

    An interesting feature of these equations is that they involve both /λ/ and
    /Dλ/. Thus the usual state variables /q/ and /Dq/, with the constraint, are
    not sufficient to determine a full set of initial conditions for the derived
    Lagrange equations; we need to specify an initial value for /λ/ as well.

    In general, for any particular physical system, equations ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.231][1.231]]) and
    ([[file:chapter001.html#disp_1.240][1.240]]) are not the same, and in fact they have different solutions. It is
    not apparent that either set of equations accurately models the physical
    system. The first approach to nonholonomic systems is not justified by
    extension of the arguments for the holo-nomic case and the other is not
    fully determined. Perhaps this indicates that the models are inadequate,
    that more details of how the constraints are maintained need to be
    specified.



* 1.11 Summary
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: h1-6f
  :CLASS:    level1
  :END:
  To analyze a mechanical system we construct an action function that gives us a
  way to distinguish realizable motions from other conceivable motions of the
  system. The action function is constructed so as to be stationary only on
  paths describing realizable motions, with respect to variations of the path.
  This is the /principle of stationary action/. The principle of stationary
  action is a coordinate-independent specification of the realizable paths. For
  systems with or without constraints we may choose any system of coordinates
  that uniquely determines the configuration of the system.

  An action is an integral of a function, the /Lagrangian/, along the path. For
  many systems an appropriate Lagrangian is the difference of the kinetic energy
  and the potential energy of the system. The choice of a Lagrangian for a
  system is not unique.

  For any system for which we have a Lagrangian action we can formulate a system
  of ordinary differential equations, the Lagrange equations, that is satisfied
  by any realizable path. The method of deriving the Lagrange equations from the
  Lagrangian is independent of the coordinate system used to formulate the
  Lagrangian. One freedom we have in formulation is that the addition of a total
  time derivative to a Lagrangian for a system yields another Lagrangian that
  has the same Lagrange equations.

  The Lagrange equations are a set of ordinary differential equations: there is
  a finite state that summarizes the history of the system and is sufficient to
  determine the future. There is an effective procedure for evolving the motion
  of the system from a state at an instant. For many systems the state is
  determined by the coordinates and the rate of change of the coordinates at an
  instant.

  If there are continuous symmetries in a physical system there are conserved
  quantities associated with them. If the system can be formulated in such a way
  that the symmetries are manifest in missing coordinates in the Lagrangian,
  then there are conserved momenta conjugate to those coordinates. If the
  Lagrangian is independent of time then there is a conserved energy.

  *Exercise 1.43: A numerical investigation*

  Consider a pendulum: a mass /m/ supported on a massless rod of length /l/ in a
  uniform gravitational field. A Lagrangian for the pendulum is

  $L(t,\theta,\overset{˙}{\theta}) = \frac{m}{2}{(l\overset{˙}{\theta})}^{2} +
  mgl\cos\theta.$

  For the pendulum, the period of the motion depends on the amplitude. We wish
  to find trajectories of the pendulum with a given frequency. Three methods of
  doing this present themselves: (1) solution by the principle of least action,
  (2) numerical integration of Lagrange's equation, and (3) analytic solution
  (which requires some exposure to elliptic functions). We will carry out all
  three and compare the solution trajectories.

  Consider the parameters /m/ = 1 kg, /l/ = 1 m, /g/ = 9.8 m s^{−2}. The
  frequency of small-amplitude oscillations is

  $\omega_{0} = \sqrt{g/l}$

  . Let's find the nontrivial solution that has the frequency

  $\omega_{1} = \frac{4}{5}\omega_{0}$

  .

  *a.* The angle is periodic in time, so a Fourier series representation is
  appropriate. We can choose the origin of time so that a zero crossing of the
  angle is at time zero. Since the potential is even in the angle, the angle is
  an odd function of time. Thus we need only a sine series. Since the angle
  returns to zero after one-half period, the angle is an odd function of time
  about the midpoint. Thus only odd terms of the series are present:

  $\theta(t) = {\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{m}{A_{n}\sin((2n - 1)\omega_{1}t).}}$

  The amplitude of the trajectory is

  $A = \theta_{\max} = {\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}{{( - 1)}^{n + 1}A_{n}}}$

  .

  Find approximations to the first few coefficients /A/_{/n/} by minimizing the
  action. You will have to write a program similar to the find-path procedure in
  [[file:chapter001.html#h1-5][section 1.4]]. Watch out: there is more than one
  trajectory that minimizes the action.

  *b.* Write a program to numerically integrate Lagrange's equations for the
  trajectories of the pendulum. The trouble with using numerical integration to
  solve this problem is that we do not know how the frequency of the motion
  depends on the initial conditions. So we have to guess, and then gradually
  improve our guess. Define a function

  $\Omega(\overset{˙}{\theta})$

  that numerically computes the frequency of the motion as a function of the
  initial angular velocity (with /θ/ = 0). Find the trajectory by solving

  $\Omega(\overset{˙}{\theta}) = \omega$

  for the initial angular velocity of the desired trajectory. Methods of solving
  this equation include successive bisection, minimizing the squared residual,
  etc.---choose one.



  *c.* Now let's formulate the analytic solution for the frequency as a function
  of amplitude. The period of the motion is simply

  $T = 4{\int_{0}^{T/4}{dt =
  4}}{\int_{0}^{A}\frac{1}{\overset{˙}{\theta}}}d\theta.$

  Using the energy, solve for

  $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

  in terms of the amplitude /A/ and /θ/ to write the required integral
  explicitly. This integral can be written in terms of elliptic functions, but
  in a sense this does not solve the problem---we still have to compute the
  elliptic functions. Let's avoid this excursion into elliptic functions and
  just do the integral numerically using the procedure definite-integral. We
  still have the problem that we can specify the amplitude /A/ and get the
  frequency; to solve our problem we need to solve the inverse problem, but that
  can be done as in part *b*.

  *Exercise 1.44: Double pendulum behavior*

  Consider the ideal double pendulum shown in
  [[file:chapter001.html#Fig_1-11][figure 1.11]].

  *a.* Formulate a Lagrangian to describe the dynamics. Derive the equations of
  motion in terms of the given angles /θ/_{1} and /θ/_{2}. Put the equations
  into a form appropriate for numerical integration. Assume the following system
  parameters:

  | /g/     | = | 9.8 m s^{−2} |
  | /l/_{1} | = | 1.0 m        |
  | /l/_{2} | = | 0.9 m        |
  | /m/_{1} | = | 1.0 kg       |
  | /m/_{2} | = | 3.0 kg       |

  *b.* Prepare graphs showing the behavior of each angle as a function of time
  when the system is started with the following initial conditions:

  | /θ/_{1}(0)                     | = | /π//2 rad    |
  | /θ/_{2}(0)                     | = | /π/ rad      |
  | ${\overset{˙}{\theta}}_{1}(0)$ | = | 0 rad s^{−1} |
  | ${\overset{˙}{\theta}}_{2}(0)$ | = | 0 rad s^{−1} |

  Make the graphs extend to 50 seconds.

  *c.* Make a graph of the behavior of the energy of your system as a function
  of time. The energy should be conserved. How good is the conservation you
  obtained?

  *d.* Make a new Lagrangian, for two identical uncoupled double pendulums.
  (Both pendulums should have the same masses and lengths.) Your new Lagrangian
  should have four degrees of freedom. Give initial conditions for one pendulum
  to be the same as in the experiment of part *b* and give initial conditions
  for the other pendulum with the /m/_{2} bob 10^{−10} m higher than before. The
  motions of the two pendulums will diverge as time progresses. Plot the
  logarithm of the absolute value of the difference of the positions of the
  /m/_{2} bobs in your two pendulums against the time. What do you see?

* Footnotes

[fn:1] A /stationary point/ of a function is a point where the function's value
does not vary as the input is varied. Local maxima or minima are stationary
points.

[fn:2] The variational formulation successfully describes all of the Newtonian
mechanics of particles and rigid bodies. The variational formulation has also
been usefully applied in the description of many other systems such as classical
electrodynamics, the dynamics of inviscid fluids, and the design of mechanisms
such as four-bar linkages. In addition, modern formulations of quantum mechanics
and quantum field theory build on many of the same concepts. However, it appears
that not all dynamical systems have a variational formulation. For example,
there is no simple prescription to apply the variational apparatus to systems
with dissipation, though in special cases variational methods can still be used.

[fn:3]We often refer to a point particle with mass but no internal structure as
a /point mass/.

[fn:4] Strictly speaking, the dimension of the configuration space and the
number of degrees of freedom are not the same. The number of degrees of freedom
is the dimension of the space of configurations that are “locally accessible.”
For systems with integrable constraints the two are the same. For systems with
non-integrable constraints the configuration dimension can be larger than the
number of degrees of freedom. For further explanation see the discussion of
systems with non-integrable constraints in [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-10-3][section 1.10.3]]. Apart from that
discussion, all of the systems we consider have integrable constraints (they are
“holonomic”). This is why we have chosen to blur the distinction between the
number of degrees of freedom and the dimension of the configuration space.

[fn:5] A tuple is an ordered list of elements. An element may itself be a tuple.

[fn:6] A tuple of functions that all have the same domain is itself a function
on that domain: Given a point in the domain, the value of the tuple of functions
is a tuple of the values of the component functions at that point.

[fn:7] The use of superscripts to index the coordinate components is
traditional, even though there is potential confusion with exponents. We use
zero-based indexing.

[fn:8] More precisely, the generalized coordinates identify open subsets of the
configuration space with open subsets of *R*/^{n}/. It may require more than one
set of generalized coordinates to cover the entire configuration space. For
example, if the configuration space is a two-dimensional sphere, we could have
one set of coordinates that maps (a little more than) the northern hemisphere to
a disk, and another set that maps (a little more than) the southern hemisphere
to a disk, with a strip near the equator common to both coordinate systems. A
space that can be locally parameterized by smooth coordinate functions is called
a /differentiable manifold/.

[fn:9] Here $\circ$ denotes composition of functions:

$$(f \circ g)(t) = f(g(t))$$

[fn:10] The derivative of a function $f$ is a function, denoted $Df$. Our
notational convention is that $D$ is a high-precedence operator. Thus $D$
operates on the adjacent function before any other application occurs: $Df(x)$
is the same as $(Df)(x)$.

[fn:11] Experience with systems on an atomic scale suggests that at this scale
systems do not travel along well-defined configuration paths. To describe the
evolution of systems on the atomic scale we employ quantum mechanics. Here, we
restrict attention to systems for which the motion is well described by a smooth
configuration path.

[fn:12] Extrapolation of the orbit of the Moon backward in time cannot determine
the point at which it was placed on this trajectory. To determine the origin of
the Moon we must supplement dynamical evidence with other physical evidence such
as chemical compositions.

[fn:13] We suspect that this argument can be promoted to a precise constraint on
the possible ways of making this path-distinguishing function.

[fn:14] Historically, Huygens was the first to use the term “action” in
mechanics, referring to “the effect of a motion.” This is an idea that came from
the Greeks. In his manuscript “Dynamica” (1690) Leibniz enunciated a “Least
Action Principle” using the “harmless action,” which was the product of mass,
velocity, and the distance of the motion. Leibniz also spoke of a “violent
action” in the case where things collided.

[fn:15] A definite integral of a real-valued function $f$ of a real argument is
written

  $\int_{a}^{b}f$

  . This can also be written

  ${\int_{a}^{b}f}(x)dx$

  . The first notation emphasizes that a function is being integrated.

[fn:16] Traditionally, square brackets are put around functional arguments. In
this case, the square brackets remind us that the value of /S/ may depend on the
function /q/ in complicated ways, such as through its derivatives.

[fn:17] In the case of a real-valued function, the value of the function and its
derivatives at some point can be used to construct a power series. For
sufficiently nice functions (real analytic), the power series constructed in
this way converges in some interval containing the point. Not all functions can
be locally represented in this way. For example, the function /f/(/x/) =
exp(−1//x/^{2}), with /f/(0) = 0, is zero and has all derivatives zero at /x/ =
0, but this infinite number of derivatives is insufficient to determine the
function value at any other point.

[fn:18] In our notation the application of a path-dependent function to its path
is of higher precedence than the composition, so /L/ ∘ Γ[/q/] = /L/ ∘ (Γ[/q/]).

[fn:19] We will later discover that an initial segment of the local tuple is
sufficient to determine the future evolution of the system. That a configuration
and a finite number of derivatives determine the future means that there is a
way of determining all of the rest of the derivatives of the path from the
initial segment.

[fn:20] The classical Lagrangian plays a fundamental role in the path-integral
formulation of quantum mechanics (due to Dirac and Feynman), where the complex
exponential of the classical action yields the relative probability amplitude
for a path. The Lagrangian is the starting point for the Hamiltonian formulation
of mechanics (discussed in chapter 3), which is also essential in the
Schrödinger and Heisenberg formulations of quantum mechanics and in the
Boltzmann--Gibbs approach to statistical mechanics.

[fn:21] The principle becomes the “principle of least action” if the path is
sufficiently short. In the more general case the action is stationary. The term
“principle of least action” is also commonly used to refer to a result, due to
Maupertuis, Euler, and Lagrange, which says that free particles move along paths
for which the integral of the kinetic energy is minimized among all paths with
the given endpoints. Correspondingly, the term “action” is sometimes used to
refer specifically to the integral of the kinetic energy. (Actually, Euler and
Lagrange used the /vis viva/, or twice the kinetic energy.)

[fn:22] Other ways of stating the principle of stationary action make it sound
teleological and mysterious. For instance, one could imagine that the system
considers all possible paths from its initial configuration to its final
configuration and then chooses the one with the smallest action. Indeed, the
underlying vision of a purposeful, economical, and rational universe played no
small part in the philosophical considerations that accompanied the initial
development of mechanics. The earliest action principle that remains part of
modern physics is Fermat's principle, which states that the path traveled by a
light ray between two points is the path that takes the least amount of time.
Fermat formulated this principle around 1660 and used it to derive the laws of
reflection and refraction. Motivated by this, the French mathematician and
astronomer Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis enunciated the principle of least
action as a grand unifying principle in physics. In his /Essai de cosmologie/
(1750) Maupertuis appealed to this principle of “economy in nature” as evidence
of the existence of God, asserting that it demonstrated “God's intention to
regulate physical phenomena by a general principle of the highest perfection.”
For a historical perspective on Maupertuis's, Euler's, and Lagrange's roles in
the formulation of the principle of least action, see [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_28][28]]].

[fn:23] For reflection the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of
reflection. Refraction is described by Snell's law: when light passes from one
medium to another, the ratio of the sines of the angles made to the normal to
the interface is the inverse of the ratio of the refractive indices of the
media. The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in the vacuum to
the speed of light in the medium.

[fn:24] Here we are making a function definition. A definition specifies the
value of the function for arbitrarily chosen formal parameters. One may change
the name of a formal parameter, so long as the new name does not conflict with
any other symbol in the definition. For example, the following definition
specifies exactly the same free-particle Lagrangian:

  $L(a,b,c) = \frac{1}{2}m(c \cdot c).$

[fn:25] The Lagrangian is formally a function of the local tuple, but any
particular Lagrangian depends only on a finite initial segment of the local
tuple. We define functions of local tuples by explicitly declaring names for the
elements of the initial segment of the local tuple that includes the elements
upon which the function depends.

[fn:26]  We represent the local tuple as a composite data structure, the
components of which are the time, the generalized coordinates, the generalized
velocities, and possibly higher derivatives. We do not want to be bothered by
the details of packing and unpacking the components into these structures, so we
provide utilities for doing this.

[fn:27] Be careful. The /x/ in the definition of /q/ is not the same as the /x/
that was used as a formal parameter in the definition of the free-particle
Lagrangian above. There are only so many letters in the alphabet, so we are
forced to reuse them. We will be careful to indicate where symbols are given new
meanings.

[fn:28] A tuple of coordinate or velocity components is made with the procedure
up. Component i of the tuple q is (ref q i). All indexing is zero based. The
word up is to remind us that in mathematical notation these components are
indexed by superscripts. There are also down tuples of components that are
indexed by subscripts. See the appendix on notation.

The constructor up is also used to package the time, the coordinates, and the
velocities into a data structure representing a local tuple. The selectors time,
coordinate, and velocity extract the appropriate pieces from the local
structure. The procedure time is the same as the procedure (component 0), and
similarly coordinate is (component 1) and velocity is (component 2).

[fn:29] Derivatives of functions yield functions. For example, ((D cube) 2) =>
12 and ((D cube) 'a) => (_{*} 3 (expt a 2)).

[fn:30] Although Γ produces an arbitrarily long local tuple, our procedure Gamma
produces by default only the first three elements. If a longer local tuple is
needed, Gamma can be given the length of the required tuple as an extra
argument.

[fn:31] In our system, arithmetic operators are generic over symbolic
expressions as well as numeric values; arithmetic procedures can work uniformly
with numbers or expressions. For example, given the procedure (define (cube x)
(_{*} x x x)) we can obtain its value for a number (cube 2) => 8 or for a
literal symbol (cube 'a) => (_{*} a a a).

[fn:32] For very complicated expressions the prefix notation of Scheme is often
better, but simplification is almost always useful. We can separate the
functions of simplification and infix display. We will see examples of this
later.

[fn:33] Scmutils includes a variety of numerical integration procedures. The
examples in this section were computed by rational-function extrapolation of
Euler--MacLaurin formulas with a relative error tolerance of 10^{−10}.

[fn:34] For a real physical situation we would have to specify units for these
quantities, but in this illustration we leave them unspecified.

[fn:35] Here we use numerals with decimal points to specify the parameters. This
forces the representations to be floating point, which is efficient for
numerical calculation. If symbolic algebra is to be done it is essential that
the numbers be exact integers or rational fractions, so that expressions can be
reliably reduced to lowest terms. Such numbers are specified without a decimal
point.

[fn:36] The squared magnitude of the velocity is $\overset{\rightarrow}{v} \cdot
 \overset{\rightarrow}{v}$

  , the vector dot product of the velocity with itself, so we write simply
  /v/^{2} = /v/ · /v/.

[fn:37] Note that we are doing arithmetic on functions. We extend the arithmetic
operations so that the combination of two functions of the same type (same
domains and ranges) is the function on the same domain that combines the values
of the argument functions in the range. For example, if /f/ and /g/ are
functions of /t/, then /fg/ is the function /t/ ↦ /f/(/t/)/g/(/t/). A constant
multiple of a function is the function whose value is the constant times the
value of the function for each argument: /cf/ is the function /t/ ↦ /cf/(/t/).

[fn:38] Note that we are adding procedures. Paralleling our extension of
arithmetic operations to functions, arithmetic operations are extended to
compatible procedures.

[fn:39] The arguments to minimize are a procedure implementing the univariate
function in question, and the lower and upper bounds of the region to be
searched. Scmutils includes a choice of methods for numerical minimization; the
one used here is Brent's algorithm, with an error tolerance of 10^{−5}. The
value returned by minimize is a list of three numbers: the first is the argument
at which the minimum occurred, the second is the minimum obtained, and the third
is the number of iterations of the minimization algorithm required to obtain the
minimum.

[fn:40] Yes, /-1.5987211554602254e-14/ is zero for the tolerance required of the
minimizer. And /435.0000000000237/ is arguably the same as /435/ obtained
before.

[fn:41] There are lots of good ways to make such a parametric set of
approximating trajectories. One could use splines or higher-order interpolating
polynomials; one could use Chebyshev polynomials; one could use Fourier
components. The choice depends upon the kinds of trajectories one wants to
approximate.

[fn:42] Here is one way to implement make-path:

   #+begin_src scheme
(define (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 qs)
  (let ((n (length qs)))
    (let ((ts (linear-interpolants t0 t1 n)))
      (Lagrange-interpolation-function
       (append (list q0) qs (list q1))
       (append (list t0) ts (list t1))))))
   #+end_src

The procedure linear-interpolants produces a list of elements that linearly
interpolate the first two arguments. We use this procedure here to specify ts,
the n evenly spaced intermediate times between t0 and t1 at which the path will
be specified. The parameters being adjusted, qs, are the positions at these
intermediate times. The procedure Lagrange-interpolation-function takes a list
of values and a list of times and produces a procedure that computes the
Lagrange interpolation polynomial that passes through these points.

[fn:43] The minimizer used here is the Nelder--Mead downhill simplex method. As
usual with numerical procedures, the interface to the nelder-mead procedure is
complex, with lots of optional parameters to let the user control errors
effectively. For this presentation we have specialized nelder-mead by wrapping
it in the more palatable multidimensional-minimize. Unfortunately, you will have
to learn to live with complicated numerical procedures someday.

[fn:44] Don't worry. We know that you don't yet know why this is the right
Lagrangian. We will get to this in [[file:chapter001.html#h1-6a][section 1.6]].

[fn:45] The square of a structure of components is defined to be the sum of the
squares of the individual components.

[fn:46] By convention, named constants have names that begin with a colon. The
constants named :pi and :-pi are what we would expect from their names.

[fn:47] The derivative or partial derivative of a function that takes structured
arguments is a new function that takes the same number and type of arguments.
The range of this new function is itself a structure with the same number of
components as the argument with respect to which the function is differentiated.
See the appendix on notation for more.

[fn:48] To make this argument more precise requires careful analysis.

[fn:49] The variation operator /δ_{η}/ is like the derivative operator in that
it acts on the immediately following function: /δ_{η}f/[/q/] = (/δ_{η}f/)[/q/].

[fn:50] We separate out the definition of /g/: We cannot substitute /Dq/ for
/g/[/q/] in /δ_{η}g/[/q/] because /δ_{η}/ applies to /g/ not /g/[/q/].

[fn:51] The type of a literal function is described by a function signature. The
default function signature is (-> Real Real) indicating a real-valued function
of a real argument. In this case F is declared as a function that is shaped like
a Lagrangian, with an unspecified number of degrees of freedom. For more
information about function signatures see the appendix on notation.

[fn:52] A function of multiple arguments is considered a function of an up tuple
of its arguments. Thus, the derivative of a function of multiple arguments is a
down tuple of the partial derivatives of that function with respect to each of
the arguments. So in the case of a Lagrangian /L/,

$$DL(t,q,v) = \lbrack\partial_{0}L(t,q,v),\partial_{1}L(t,q,v),\partial_{2}L(t,q,v)\rbrack.$$

[fn:53] When we write a definition that names the components of the local tuple,
we indicate that these are grouped into time, position, and velocity components
by separating the groups with semicolons.

[fn:54] The symbol $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

is just a mnemonic symbol; the dot over the /θ/ does not indicate
differentiation. To define /L/ we could have just as well have written:

$$L(a,b,c) = \frac{1}{2}ml^{2}c^{2} + mgl\cos b$$

. However, we use a dotted symbol to remind us that the argument matching a
formal parameter, such as

  $\overset{˙}{\theta}$

, is a rate of change of an angle, such as /θ/.

[fn:55] In traditional notation these equations read

$$\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\overset{¨}{q}} -
\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\overset{˙}{q}} + \frac{\partial
L}{\partial q} = 0.$$

[fn:56] The Lagrange-equations procedure uses the operations (partial 1) and
(partial 2), which implement the partial derivative operators with respect to
the second and third argument positions (those with indices 1 and 2).

[fn:57] There is a Lagrange equation for every degree of freedom. The residuals of
all the equations are zero if the path is realizable. The residuals are arranged
in a down tuple because they result from derivatives of the Lagrangian with
respect to argument slots that take up tuples. See the appendix on notation.

[fn:58] Observe that the second derivative is indicated as the square of the
derivative operator (expt D 2). Arithmetic operations in Scmutils extend over
operators as well as functions.

[fn:59] Remember that /x/ and /v/ are just formal parameters of the Lagrangian.
This /x/ is not the path /x/ used earlier in the derivation, though it could be
the value of that path at a particular time.

[fn:60] We can always give a function extra arguments that are not used so that
it can be algebraically combined with other functions of the same shape.

[fn:61] William Rowan Hamilton formulated the fundamental variational principle
for time-independent systems in 1834--1835. Jacobi gave this principle the name
“Hamilton's principle.” For systems subject to generic, nonstationary
constraints Hamilton's principle was investigated in 1848 by Ostrogradsky, and
in the Russian literature Hamilton's principle is often called the
Hamilton--Ostrogradsky principle.

Hamilton (1805--1865) was a brilliant mathematician. His early work on geometric
optics (based on Fermat's principle) was so impressive that he was elected to
the post of Professor of Astronomy at Trinity College and Royal Astronomer of
Ireland while he was still an undergraduate. He produced two monumental works of
mathematics. His discovery of quaternions revitalized abstract algebra and
sparked the development of vector techniques in physics. His 1835 memoir “On a
General Method in Dynamics” put variational mechanics on a firm footing, finally
giving substance to Maupertuis's vaguely stated Principle of Least Action of 100
years before. Hamilton also wrote poetry and carried on an extensive
correspondence with Wordsworth, who advised him to put his energy into writing
mathematics rather than poetry.

In addition to the formulation of the fundamental variational principle,
Hamilton also emphasized the analogy between geometric optics and mechanics, and
stressed the importance of the momentum variables (which were earlier introduced
by Lagrange and Cauchy), leading to the “canonical” form of mechanics discussed
in chapter 3.

[fn:62] When applied to a tuple, square means the sum of the squares of the
components of the tuple.

[fn:63] As described in footnote [fn:26] above, the procedure up constructs a local
tuple from an initial segment of time, coordinates, and velocities.

[fn:64] We hope you appreciate the T_{E}X magic here. Symbols with carets,
underlines, the names of Greek letters, and those terminating in the characters
“dot” are converted by show-expression to the corresponding T_{E}X expression.

[fn:65] We will simply accept the Newtonian procedure for systems with rigid
constraints and find Lagrangians that are equivalent. Of course, actual bodies
are never truly rigid, so we may wonder what detailed approximations have to be
made to treat them as if they were truly rigid. For instance, a more satisfying
approach would be to replace the rigid distance constraints by very stiff
springs. We could then immediately write the Lagrangian as /L/ = /T/ − /V/, and
we should be able to /derive/ the Newtonian procedure for systems with rigid
constraints as an approximation. However, this is too complicated to do at this
stage, so we accept the Newtonian idealization.

[fn:66] This Lagrangian is purely formal and does not represent a model of the
constraint forces. In particular, note that the constraint terms do not add up
to a potential energy with a minimum when the constraints are exactly satisfied.
Rather, the constraint terms in the Lagrangian are zero when the constraint is
satisfied, and can be either positive or negative depending on whether the
distance between the particles is larger or smaller than the constraint
distance.

[fn:67] Typically the number of components of /x/ is equal to the sum of the
number of components of /q/ and /c/; adding a strut removes a degree of freedom
and adds a distance constraint. However, there are singular cases in which the
addition of single strut can remove more than a single degree of freedom. We do
not consider the singular cases here.

[fn:68] Consider a function /g/ of, say, three arguments, and let /g/_{0} be a
function of two arguments satisfying /g/_{0}(/x/, /y/) = /g/(/x/, /y/, 0). Then
(∂_{0}/g/_{0})(/x/, /y/) = (∂_{0}/g/)(/x/, /y/, 0). The substitution of a value
in an argument commutes with the taking of the partial derivative with respect
to a different argument. In deriving the Lagrange equations for /q/ we can set
/c/ = /l/ and

  $\overset{˙}{c} = 0$

  in the Lagrangian, but we cannot do this in deriving the Lagrange equations
  associated with /c/, because we have to take derivatives with respect to those
  arguments.

[fn:69] /R_{z}/(/α/) yields a function that rotates its argument about the /ẑ/
axis by the angle /α/, and /R_{y}/ is similar.

[fn:70] Components of a tuple structure, such as the value of Γ[/q/](/t/), can
be selected with selector functions: /I_{i}/ gets the element with index /i/
from the tuple.

[fn:71] The Lipschitz condition is that the rate of change of the state is
bounded by a constant in an open set around each state. See [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_25][25]]] for a good
treatment of the Lipschitz condition.

[fn:72] If the coordinates are redundant we cannot, in general, solve for the
highest-order derivative. However, since we can transform to irredundant
coordinates, since we can solve the initial-value problem in the irredundant
coordinates, and since we can construct the redundant coordinates from the
irredundant coordinates, we can in general solve the initial-value problem for
redundant coordinates. The only hitch is that we cannot specify arbitrary
initial conditions: the initial conditions must be consistent with the
constraints.

[fn:73] We may encounter singularities that make this matrix uninvertable, but
in real systems these singularities are isolated and can be avoided by changing
coordinates.

[fn:74] For Lagrangians that depend on time, coordinates, and velocities the
state is specified by time, coordinates, and velocities. However, if a
Lagrangian depends on the first four components of the local tuple (time,
coordinates, velocities, and accelerations) the state of the system will be
specified by the first five components of the local tuple.

[fn:75] The procedure solve-linear-left multiplies its second argument by the
inverse of its first argument on the left. So, if /u/ = /Mv/ then /v/ =
/M/^{−1}/u/; (solve-linear-left M u) produces v.

[fn:76] The Scmutils system provides a variety of numerical integration routines
that can be accessed through this interface. These include quality-controlled
Runge--Kutta and Bulirsch--Stoer. The default integration method is
Bulirsch--Stoer.

[fn:77] The procedure state-advancer automatically compiles state-derivative
procedures the first time they are encountered. The first time a new state
derivative is used there is a delay while compilation occurs.

[fn:78] The results are plotted in a plot window created by the procedure frame
with arguments xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax that specify the limits of the
plotting area. Points are added to the plot with the procedure plot-point that
takes a plot window and the abscissa and ordinate of the point to be plotted.

The procedure principal-value is used to reduce an angle to a standard interval.
The argument to principal-value is the point at which the circle is to be cut.
Thus (principal-value :pi) is a procedure that reduces an angle /θ/ to the
interval −/π/ ≤ /θ < /π/./

[fn:79] In older literature conserved quantities are sometimes called /first
integrals/.

[fn:80] Observe that we indicate a component of the generalized momentum with a
subscript, and a component of the generalized coordinates with a superscript.
These conventions are consistent with those commonly used in tensor algebra,
which is sometimes helpful in working out complex problems.

[fn:81] For example, we may construct equivalent Lagrangians that differ only by
a total time derivative. The momentum state functions for these Lagrangians are
different.

[fn:82] In general, conserved quantities in a physical system are associated
with continuous symmetries, whether or not one can find a coordinate system in
which the symmetry is apparent. This powerful notion was formalized and a
theorem linking conservation laws with symmetries was proved by Noether early in
the 20th century. See [[file:chapter001.html#h3_1-8-5][section 1.8.5]] on Noether's theorem.

[fn:83] The sign of the energy state function is a matter of convention.

[fn:84] We may construct equivalent Lagrangians that differ only by a total time
derivative. The energy state functions for these Lagrangians are different.

[fn:85] A function /f/ is homogenous of degree /n/ if and only if /f/(/ax/) =
/a^{n}f/(/x/). Euler's theorem says that if /f/ is a homogeneous function of
degree /n/, then /Df/(/x/)/x/ = /nf/(/x/). The proof is as follows: Let
/g_{x}/(/a/) = /f/(/ax/). Then /Dg_{x}/(/a/) = /Df/(/ax/)/x/. But /g_{x}/(/a/) =
/a^{n}f/(/x/) by the definition of homogeneity. Therefore /Dg_{x}/(/a/) =
/na/^{/n/−1}/f/(/x/). Equating these, we find /Df/(/ax/)/x/ =
/na/^{/n/−1}/f/(/x/). Specializing to /a/ = 1 we obtain /Df/(/x/)/x/ = /nf/(/x/)
as required.

[fn:86] Traditionally the Jacobi constant is defined as /C_{J}/ = −2/ℰ/.

[fn:87] The total time derivative is like a derivative with respect to a
real-number argument in that it does not generate structure, so it can commute
with derivatives that generate structure. Be careful, though: it may not commute
with some derivatives for other reasons. For example,

$$D_{t}\partial_{1}(\widetilde{F}(s))$$

is the same as

$$\partial_{1}D_{t}(\widetilde{F}(s))$$

, but

$$D_{t}\partial_{2}(\widetilde{F}(s))$$

is not the same as

$$\partial_{2}D_{t}(\widetilde{F}(s))$$

. The reason is that

$$\widetilde{F}(s)$$

does not depend on the velocity, but

$$D_{t}(\widetilde{F}(s))$$

does.

[fn:88] The definition of the procedure =Rx= is

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((Rx angle) q)
  (let ((ca (cos angle))
        (sa (sin angle)))
    (let ((x (ref q 0))
          (y (ref q 1))
          (z (ref q 2)))
      (up x
          (- (* ca y) (* sa z))
          (+ (* sa y) (* ca z))))))
#+end_src

The definitions of =Ry= and =Rz= are similar. See footnote [fn:69].

[fn:89] The local-tuple function /f/ is the same as the local-tuple function

$$\overline{\Gamma}(\overline{f})$$

where

  $\overline{f}\lbrack q\rbrack = f \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$

. On the other hand, the path function

$$\overline{f}\lbrack q\rbrack$$

and the path function

$$\overline{\Gamma}(\overline{f}) \circ \Gamma\lbrack q\rbrack$$

are not necessarily the same because

$$\overline{f}\lbrack q\rbrack$$

may require more components of the local tuple than are provided by default. For
example, the Lagrange equations involve accelerations, as well as time,
coordinates, and velocities. If Γ[/q/] is extended to the appropriate number of
components then the two are equivalent. (See footnote [fn:90].)

[fn:90] This F->C is more general than the code introduced on [[file:chapter001.html#p46][page 46]] in that it
allows computation of transformations of higher derivatives of the local tuple,
if required.

To make this work, Gamma is also extended to generate more elements of the local
tuple than are needed for Lagrangians that depend on time, coordinates, and
velocities. Here Gamma is given one more argument than it usually has. This
optional argument gives the length of the initial segment of the local tuple
needed. The default length is 3, giving components of the local tuple up to and
including the velocities.

[fn:91] Given any acceptable variation, we may make another acceptable variation
by multiplying the given one by a bump function that emphasizes any particular
time interval.

[fn:92] We take two tuple-valued functions of time to be orthogonal if at each
instant the dot product of the tuples is zero. Similarly, tuple-valued functions
are considered parallel if at each moment one of the tuples is a scalar multiple
of the other. The scalar multiplier is in general a function of time.

[fn:93] Recall that the Euler--Lagrange operator $\mathcal{E}$

has the property

$$\mathcal{E}\,\lbrack FG\rbrack = F\,\mathcal{E}\lbrack G\rbrack +
\mathcal{E}\lbrack F\rbrack G + D_{t}F\,\partial_{2}G + \partial_{2}F\,
D_{t}G.$$

[fn:94] This constraint has the same form as those used in the demonstration
that /L/ = /T/ − /V/ can be used for rigid systems. Here it is a particular
example of a more general set of constraints.

[fn:95] Indeed, if we had scaled the constraint equations as we did in the
discussion of Newtonian constraint forces, we could have identified /λ/ with the
the magnitude of the constraint force /F/. However, though /λ/ will in general
be related to the constraint forces it will not be one of them. We chose to
leave the scaling as it naturally appeared rather than make things turn out
artificially pretty.

[fn:96] This example appears in [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_20][20]]], pp. 49--51.

[fn:97] We will see in chapter 2 how to compute the kinetic energy of rotation,
but for now the answer is

$$\frac{1}{2}M\, R^{2}{\overset{˙}{\theta}}^{2}.$$

[fn:98] For some treatments of nonholonomic systems see, for example, Whittaker
[[[file:bibliography.html#bib_46][46]]], Goldstein [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_20][20]]], Gantmakher [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_19][19]]], or Arnold et al. [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_6][6]]].

[fn:99] Arnold et al. [[[file:bibliography.html#bib_6][6]]] call the variational mechanics with the constraints
added to the Lagrangian /Vakonomic mechanics/.
